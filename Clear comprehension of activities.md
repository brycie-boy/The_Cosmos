## Clear comprehension of activities  #🧠 

Clear comprehension of activities, a meditation subject of the [[Contemplation of body]], is explained below per the Buddha:

> “Again, monks, a monk is one who acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning ... when looking ahead and looking away ...  when bending and stretching his limbs ... when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl ... when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting ... when defecating and urinating ... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.
