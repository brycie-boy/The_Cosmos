## The four establishments of mindfulness  # 

The discourse in Buddhism considered to provide the most comprehensive instructions on meditation practice is the establishments of mindfullness discourse.   The establishments of [[Mindfulness]] discourse does not recommend a single object of meditation, nor do they provide any paticular methods of meditation. instead, their purpose is to explain how to establish the appropriate mode of contemplation in order to arrive at the realization of [[Nibbana]]. According to the standard formula that accompanies each exersize, an establishment of [[Mindfulness]] is a mode of dwelling. That mode of dwelling involves the observation of objects in the proper state of mind. This state of mind consists of three positive qualities: energy, [[Mindfulness]], and clear comprehension. The establishments of [[Mindfulness]] are divided into four major sections. 

- [[Contemplation of body]]
- [[Contemplation of feeling]]
- [[Contemplation of mind]]
- [[Contemplation of phenomena]]

These means can be used to develop [[Serenity]]. but the establishments of [[Mindfulness]] system as a whole seems especially designed for the development of [[Insight]].
