“And on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.”

The dust of [[☁️ The Stellar Nursery]] has now been completely cleared and condensed into an clear, distinct, cohesive thought. The growing pains of the [[⛅️ Proto Notes]] are now over and the note has reached a stable state. The note has now entered the main sequence stage and has evolved into a fully mature star, capable of spreading its light across The Cosmos.
