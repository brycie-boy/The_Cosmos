## Idolatry  # 

Idolatry is term given by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] to what he calls the stage of semantic innocence when the fact that [[Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]] or that [[Any ideas which we deem certain or factual are only conjectural and inferitial]] is either  forgotten or repressed or has not yet been learned. It is the stage of innocence or arrogance in which the fifth stage of [[The five stages of the perception process]], that is, somebodys edited and final version of [[Perception]], or there [[Emic Reality]], is confused with the first stage, the object, event or [[Etic Reality]] "out there."

To the idolator, things or events "really are" what appear to be as coded in there favorite [[Reality tunnel]]. Any other [[Reality tunnel]], however useful it may appear to others in different contexts, must then be "mad" or bad—delusory or fraudulent. Any body who disagrees to the idolator must be, by definition, a loony or a liar. According ot Wilson, this is the mentality that underlies all inquisitions, and he calls it Fundementalism when it appears in as an active social ideology
