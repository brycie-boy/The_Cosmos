## The three standpoints  #🧠

In order to deepen our perspective on the world, the Buddha provided three standpoints from which we can we can appraise our desires and values. These three standpoints can also represent three moments or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common sense attitudes and moves toward higher wisdom, enlightenment, and [[Nibbana]]. These three moments are: 

- gratification
- danger
- escape

Gratification consists in the pleasure and joy we experience when we succeed in fullfilling our desires. If we take an deeper look, in a dispassionate frame of mind, we can see that such pleasure and joy are far from satisfactory, To the contrary, they hold various drawbacks, or dangers. The most prominent dangers being the fact that such pleasures are impermanent, discontent, and subject to change or decay. Once we see that our desires are flawed and beset with hidden dangers, we then realize that the way to escape such dangers lies in removing our attachment to them.
