There are three standpoints provided by the Buddha from which we can we can appraise the values in which we order our lives. These three standpoints can also represent three moments or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common sense attitudes and moves toward higher knowledge, enlightenment, and release. These three moments are: 

- [[gratification]]
- [[danger]]
- [[escape]]
