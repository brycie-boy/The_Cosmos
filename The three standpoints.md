## The three standpoints  # üß†

There are three standpoints provided by the Buddha from which we can we can appraise the values in which we order our lives. These three standpoints can also represent three moments or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common sense attitudes and moves toward higher knowledge, enlightenment, and release. These three moments are: 

- Gratification

One begins by recognizing the fact that wordly phenomena such as sense objects, forms, and feelings give us some degree of gratification. This gratification consists in the pleasure and joy we experience when we succeed in fullfilling our goals. Once we agknowledge this fact, we can then probe deeper by asking weather such pleasure is entirley satisfactory.

- danger
- escape
