## No entity is isolated and self-enclosed but is inherently linked to other things in a complex web of dependently originated processes  #üß† 

In his discourse on right view, [[SƒÅriputta]] intended to elucidate the principles that are meant to understood through [[Conceptual understanding]] and penetrated through [[Experiental understanding]]. He expounds these principals under sixteen headings: [[Wholesome kamma]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]], [[The four nutriments of life]], [[The four nobel truths]], the twelve factors of [[Dependant Origination]], and [[The taints]]. from the second section to the end of the sutta, he frames all his expositions in accordance with the same pattern, a pattern that reveals the principle of conditionality to be the scaffolding for the entire teaching. Whatever phenomenon he takes up, he expounds by bringing to light its individual nature, its arising, its cessation, and the way to its cessation. This pattern is what [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] refers to as "the four truth pattern" becuase it underlies [[The four nobel truths]]. This pattern recurs throughout [[The Nikayas]] as one of the major templates through which phenomena are to be viewed to arrive at true wisdom and [[Nibbana]]. Its application makes it clear that no entity is isolated and self-enclosed but is, rather, inherently linked to other things in a complex web of dependently originated processes. The key to attaining [[Nibbana]] lies in understanding the causes that sustain this web and bringing them to an end within oneself. This is done by practicing [[the Noble Eightfold Path]], the way to extinguish those causes.
