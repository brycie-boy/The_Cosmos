## A true understanding of an idea can only be obtained through ones own personal validation of it  # 

In contrast with the fact that [[many systems of thought promote ideas which require a degree of faith and insist upon our absolute trust in them]], [[the Buddha]] insists to the Kalamas that they do not come to conclusions by placing faith in doctrines that lie beyond the range of our immediate experience. Rather than ask us to wrestle with issues that for us in our present condition no amount of experience can decide, he instead asks us to consider a few simple questions, questions that we can answer on the basis of personal experience.

The Kalamas were a group of people living in the remote area of the Ganges plain. Various religous teachers would come to visit them and each would extol their own doctrines and tear down the doctrines their rivals. Confused by this conflict between belief systems, the Kalamas did not know whom to trust. When [[The Buddha]] passed by there town, they approached him and asked him for advice. [[The Buddha]] then offered them a simple and pragmatic outlet from the morass of doubt and perplexity in which they are immersed. By the use of skillful methods of inquiry, he leads them to understand a number of basic principles that they can verify by their own experience and thereby acquire a sure starting point for further intellectual development.

[[The Buddha]] states ten fallible sources from which knowledge should not be immediately viewed as truthful without further investigation. The first four of these pertain to establilshed scriptural authourity: [[Appeal to majority]], [[Appeal to tradition]], appeal to annecdotal evidence, appeal to scriptural authority. The next four pertain to rational grounds: The [[Pure Reason fallacy]], inferintial reasoning, [[Appeal to common sense]], and the [[Mind projection fallacy]]. The final two pertain to authoritive persons: [[Appeal to accomplishment]], and [[Appeal to authority]].
