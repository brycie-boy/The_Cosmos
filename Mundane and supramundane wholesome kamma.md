## Mundane and supramundane wholesome kamma #🧠 

Whereas [[kamma]] springing from unwholesome roots are bound to the world of repeated birth and death, [[kamma]] springing from wholesome roots may be of two catagoties, the mundane and the supramundane. The mundane [[wholesome kamma]] have the potential to produce a fortunate rebirth within the round of rebirths. The supramundane [[wholesome kamma]] is kamma that leads to the escape from the round of rebirths and is generated by developing [[The Nobel Eightfold Path]] and the other aids to enlightenment, leading to liberation from the round of rebirths. This is the [[kamma]] that dismantles the entire kammic process.
