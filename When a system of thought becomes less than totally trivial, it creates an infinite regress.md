## When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, it creates an infinite regress  # 

All thought consists of the manipulation of symbols according to [[Game Rules]]. The combination of symbols and rules for manipulating those symbols makes up a system. When stripped to their mathematico-logical bones, all systems seem appear to be either trivial or dubious. If trivial, they are certain, but we cannot learn much from them because they refer to very little. As soon as a system becomes less than totally trivial, and refers to more and more, a species of [[Infinite Regress]] begins and it becomes increasingly uncertain: we have to prove an endless series of steps between step A and step B before we can move on to step C. 

An example of this regress, from [[Lewis Carroll]], in [[Douglass Hofstrader]]'s book Godel Escher Bach, is simplified as follows: "I never eat animals because they are our brothers" said an American student of Buddhism. "Why shouldnt we eat our brothers?" asked the Zen roshi. The Zen student had a simple formula which can be abbreviated: Animals are not our brothers, we should not eat our brothers, therefor we should not eat animals. Once this is analyzed critically, a new arguement begins, and that arguement can be analyzed at any point, and thus an infinite regress is created. 

In "common sense" such propositions can be considered absurd and discarded. But any system which claims certitanty must answer all challanges. Since this would take an infinite amount of time, it has not yet been performed, and the foundations of every mathematical-logical systems today are increasingly considered formal [[Game Rules]] and not eternal "laws of thought" as they seemed to be from [[Aristotle]] to about the time of [[Immanuel Kant]].
