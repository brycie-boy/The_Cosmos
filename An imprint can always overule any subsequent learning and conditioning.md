## An imprint can always overule any subsequent learning and conditioning  #üß† 

An [[imprint]], being type of software that has become frozen into hardware, makes Imprints a non-negotiable aspect of our individuality. Out of the infinite amount of possible programs that can exist as potential software, [[imprint]]s set the limits, parameters, and perimeters with which all subsequent conditioning and learning occurs. Each succesive [[imprint]] further complicates the software which programs what we experience as "reality". [[Conditioning]] and [[Learning (ethology)]] build networks into this bedrock of [[imprint]]ed software. The total structure of this brain circuitry makes up our map of the world. It is what our Thinker thinks, and our Prover mechanically fits all incoming signals to the limitations of this map. ([[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]])
