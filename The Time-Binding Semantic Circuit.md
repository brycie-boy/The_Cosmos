## The Time-Binding Semantic Circuit  # 

The Time-Bending Sementic Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted and conditioned by human artifacts and symbol systems. It "handles" and "packages" the enviroment, classifying everything according to the local reality tunnel. Inventing, calculating, predicting, and transmitting signals across generations are its functions.
