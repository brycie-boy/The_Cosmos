## The Time-Binding Semantic Circuit  # 

The Time-Bending Sementic Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted and conditioned by human artifacts and symbol systems. Inventing, calculating, predicting, and transmitting signals across generations are its functions. This circuit handles artifacts and creates a "map" (reality-tunnel) which can be a passed on to other people and even across generations. These "maps" may be paintings, blueprints, concepts, tools (with instructions on use transmitted verbally), theories, and music. If Moses, Confucius, [[The Buddha]], Mohammed, Jesus and St. Paul can be considered living influences‚Äîand they are: look around the world‚Äîthis is only because their Signal has been carried to us by human symbol systems. These systems include words, artwork, music, rituals, and unrecognized rituals ("games") through which culture is transmitted. 

The samantic ciruit allows us to sub-divide things and reconnect things at pleasure. There is no end to its labeling and packaging of experience. On the personal level, it is the "internal monologe" discovered by [[James Joyce]] in Ulysess. On the historical level, it is the time-binding function decribed by [[Alfred Korzybski]], which allows each generation to add new catagories to out mental library‚Äîconnecting new things, seperating new things, reclassifying and shuffling forever.

In ordinary language, the semantic circuit is usually called "the mind". As psychologist [[Robert Ornstein]] said in a radio show, when we say someone ‚Äúhas a good mind,‚Äù we generally mean they have a good mouth, i.e., they use the semantic circuit well.

The semantic circuit appeared perhaps 100 thousand years ago.
