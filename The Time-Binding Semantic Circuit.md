## The Time-Binding Semantic Circuit  # 

The Time-Bending Sementic Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], handles artifacts and creates a "map" (reality-tunnel) which can be a passed on to other people and even across generations. These "maps" may be paintings, blueprints, concepts, tools (with instructions on use transmitted verbally), theories, and music. If Moses, Confucius, [[The Buddha]], Mohammed, Jesus and St. Paul can be considered living influences‚Äîand they are: look around the world‚Äîthis is only because their Signal has been carried to us by human symbol systems. These systems include words, artwork, music, rituals, and unrecognized rituals ("games") through which culture is transmitted. The samantic ciruit allows us to sub-divide things and reconnect things at pleasure. There is no end to its labeling and packaging of experience. On the personal level, it is the "internal monologe" discovered by [[James Joyce]] in Ulysess. On the historical level, it is the time-binding function decribed by [[Alfred Korzybski]], which allows each generation to add new catagories to our mental library‚Äîconnecting new things, seperating new things, reclassifying and shuffling forever.

In this time-binding dimemsion, [[Albert Einstein]] replaced [[Isaac Newton]] before most of the world had heard of Newton (Most of the world was illiterate until the 1970s) ; simple arithmetic gave birth to algebra, which brought forth calculus, which produced tensor calculus, etc. [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Mozart]] prepared the way for [[Ludwig Beethoven]], who broke into the realms that the Romantics and Wagnerians took over, which gave birth to what is called music today. So called "future shock" has always been with us since this circuit began funtioning somewhere in pre-history. n a symbolizing, calculating, abstracting species, all times are ‚Äútimes of change.‚Äù The process is however accelerating faster as time passes, because the symbolizing faculty is inherently self-augmenting.

In ordinary language, the semantic circuit is usually called "the mind". As psychologist [[Robert Ornstein]] said in a radio show, when we say someone ‚Äúhas a good mind,‚Äù we generally mean they have a good mouth, i.e., they use the semantic circuit well.

The semantic circuit appeared perhaps 100 thousand years ago. [[Carl Sagan]] called this circuit ‚Äúthe human brain.‚Äù
