## Those who take there heaviest imprint on the semantic circuit tend to be cerebrotonic  # 

Those extreme cases who take their heaviest [[imprint]] on the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] tend to grow up cerebrotonic. they are tall and skinny, because energy is perpetually drawn upwards toward the head. The caricatured evil genius, Dr. Syvlanus in Superman, who was virtually all head, represents the extreme toward which this type seems to be evolving. Popular speech calls them ‚Äúeggheads". Almost always, these cerebrotonic Third-Circuit types ignore or are hostile to their first and second circuit functions. Playfulness puzzles them (appears silly or eccentric) and emotions both baffle and frighten them.
