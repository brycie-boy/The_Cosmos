## The external world that we percieve is a only the product of the brains interperting, editing, and classifying of it  #

The late  [[R. Buckminster Fuller]] used to astonish audiences by casually remarking in the middle of a lecture that everything we see is all inside of our heads. If the consternation of the audience was voluble, Fuller stop and would explain that when the light rays from an object travel to the lens of the eye, like all lenses, it reverses them. The retina then registers the reversed "image". We do not see things upside down because the retina is part of a synergetic eye-brain system and before [[Consciousness]] of the object arises, the function of [[Perception]] has already interperted and classified the signal according to the brains system of classification, which includes turning the image around and meshing it with the geometrical coordinate system the brain uses to file data.

The following exersize is used to demonstrate this phenomena for oneself. Ask someone to cooroperate and then go get a newspaper that you have not already glanced at. SIt in a chair and have the person hold up the newspaper so that you can read the front page headlines, walk away slowly, across the room, until the headlines become blurry to you. Have the person turn the page to ensure that you cannot read the headlines. Then have them, holding the newspaper in the same position, read the headline out loud. You will then "see" the headline cleary.

[[Aristotle]], without knowing the modern laws of optics, understood this general principle well enough to point out that the expression "i see" is an incorrect expression and should really be "i have seen". There is always time, however small, between the external signals impression onto the internal [[Six sense bases]] and the [[Perception]] in our brains. In that time, the brain imposes form, meaning, quality, and a great deal else.
