## Nibbana  #üß†

Nibbana is often defined as the destruction of [[The three unwholesome roots]]. But nibbana is not simply the destruction of defilements and an exhaulted feeling of psychological well-being. [[The Nikayas]] often speak of nibbana almost as if it were a transedent state or demension of being. They refer nibbana as a "base" beyond the world of common experience where none of [[The great elements]] or even the demensions of [[The formless attainments]] are present. It is a state completely quiesent, without arising, parishing or change, It is often refered to as "the unborn, unmade, unbecome, and unconditioned", the existance of which make possible deliverance from what is born, made, come to be, and conditioned.

The way that seemes faithful to both aspects of nibbana delianated within the texts is to regard the attainment of nibbana as a state of freedom and happiness attainedby realizing, though [[Insight]], the unconditioned and trancendent element, the state that is intrinsically tranquil and is forever beyond dissatisfaction. The penetration of this element brings the destruction of defilements, culminating in complete purification of mind. Such purification is accompanied by the experience of perfect peace and happiness in this present life. With the break up of the body at physical death, it brings irriversible release from beginningless [[Samsara]].
