## Stream-entry #🧠 

Stream-entry is the first stage of [[The four stages toward enlightenment]].  This stage involves the eradication of the first three fetters: [[Identity view]], doubt, and the  belief that mere external observances, paticularly religious rituals and ascetic practices, can lead to liberation. The stream enterer is assured of attaining [[Nibbana]] in atmost seven more existences, which may take place in [[The sense-sphere realm]]s.
