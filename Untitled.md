## The world that we live in is an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind #flashcard 

The twin doctrines of [[Kamma and rebirth]] enables us to see that the world that we live in is  an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind. The reason why a living being is reborn in a paticular realm is because in a previous life that being has generated the kamma. Thus, all the realms of existance have been formed, fashioned, and sustained by the mental activity of living beings. The Buddha refers to kamma as the field, consciousness as the seed, and craving as the moisture, for conciosness to be established in a new realm of existance.
