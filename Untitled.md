##  #flashcard 

On the basis of ethical qualilty, kamma is distinguished into two major catagories. the wholesome and the unwholesome. Unwholesome kamma is an action that is afflictive to the agent, morally reprehensible, and brings painful results, or a hellish experience, and resulting in unfortunate rebirth,. The criterion for judging an action as unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots". There are three unwholesome roots:  

- greed
- hatred
- delusion

From there arises a variety of secondary defilements, such as:

- anger
- hostility
- envy
- selfishness
- arrogance
- pride
- presumption
- laziness

From the root defilements and secondary defilements arise defiled actions. Wholesome kamma is an action that is non-afflictive to the agent, morally commendable, brings pleasant results, or a heavenly experience, and results  in fortunate rebirth, or a heavenly experience. Its underlying motives are the three wholesome roots: 

- generosity
- loving-kindness
- wisdom



There are ten types of each class of kamma, also known as the ten pathways of wholesome and unwholsome kamma. The ten are subdivided into the three goups called the "three doors of action", that is, body, speech, and mind. Wholesome kamma is refered to as "righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma" while unwholesome kamma is refered to as “unrighteous conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma”

There are three types of bodily misconduct:

- killing
- stealing
- and sexual misconduct

There are four types of verbal misconduct:

- lying
- malicious speech
- harsh speech
- gossip

There are three types of mental misconduct; 

- covetousness
- ill will
- wrong view

The ten types of wholesome kamma are the reason why beings are born in bad destinations, or in a hellish world after death. The ten types of wholesome kamma are the reason why beings are reborn in good destinations, or in a heavenly world after death.
