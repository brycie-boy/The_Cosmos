Politics are about passing laws and laws are about forcing people to do things against there own will. Most people who vote are driven through fear. People have points of view in which they wish to impose upon others for the sake of there safety. 

One thing of learned through out my life were there short comings of fear based teaching. When people are taught what to do through fear, they donâ€™t actually learn why what they do is bad. Their ideas of good and bad are just arbitrary. They only do things because they fear punishment

Wether in the microcosmic scale like the household or the macrocosmic scale like a country. Fear based teaching is the same. It doesnâ€™t matter whatâ€™s scale, itâ€™s never justified.

Laws are a poor place to base your values on. Laws teach you what you have to do, not what you should do. Politics doesnâ€™t teach ethics or reasoning. It only teaches laws. It doesnâ€™t teach the reasoning behind why you should follow these guidelines. law only says that you should do it or else. Your morals would be based on fear, not understanding,

Things like philosophy and psychology actually teach these things. They talk about how the world works and how people work, why they do the things they do. Through this you can establish your values. And any moral guidelines they provide actually have reasoning behind them

And this is where people tend to scoff at me but, if people genuinely understood and respected each other then there really wouldnâ€™t be a point in laws. Why would people have any reason to kill, steal, etc? Maybe we should be teaching people how to understand and respect each rather than teaching them what political system they should support. Maybe then we could eventually transcend laws. 

  

I feel like itâ€™s pretty prideful that we decide to intervene and punish people ourselves. Itâ€™s as if we are so certain of whatâ€™s right and wrong with the world that we need to force people to do these things. When we lock people up in jail, or anything else, people donâ€™t actually get to witness the actual consequences of their actions. People face the consequences of there actions through natural causes. What goes around comes around. Maybe we should leave the judging up to nature rather than taking it on ourselves. Nature always seems to balance things. When we intervene with these process, are we not saying we know better than nature?

  

People have to start looking internally for answers rather than externally. As long as people are rotten on the inside, every system will eventually be corrupted. Thereâ€™s no perfect political system that will fix everything. You canâ€™t force people to do anything it never works out. When people donâ€™t actually understand the consequences of there actions. The urges are only suppressed through force, not eliminated. This will backfire because these people will eventually break and theyâ€™ll want to let these urges out. I think thatâ€™s why we see so much chaos lately.

With democracy, I feel like it gives you the illusion of freedom, because if your in a political minority, then itâ€™s pointless to vote. Youâ€™re vote will always be vastly outweighed by the majority. The majority are usually influenced by fear based propaganda. People vote for certain systems because they want others to be forced to do things because theyâ€™re want to feel a sense of safety. Yes most votes are emotional, not logical. The person who usually gets elected on the one who gets the most funding because they have the most widespread and effective advertising. In order to really make a difference politically youâ€™d have to have a lot of money.

  

When you base your ethical values on law, you can be easily manipulated into following bogus laws because you donâ€™t actually know why what your doing is good or bad

  

Iâ€™ve realized that I have no control over any worldly affairs and Iâ€™m better off using the time I worry about politics on focusing on my own self improvement, which os something I actually can control. I think I should only care about anything political when it directly interferes with something Iâ€™m trying to accomplish, which the majority of the time it isnâ€™t. Im better off making the best out of the political state of the world rather than trying to change it in anyway.

When people base there morals and values on law, theyâ€™re easily manipulated because they donâ€™t really understand why they do what they do
