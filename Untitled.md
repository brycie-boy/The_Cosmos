## Merit #flashcard 

Merit is wholesome kamma capable of yielding favorable results within the cycle of rebirths. Merit produces mundane benefits such as a good rebirth, wealth, beauty, and success. It also serves as an enhancing condition for supramundane benefits, that is, for attaining the stages along the path to enlightenment. Merit is organized into the groups known as "the three bases of merit", included are:

- Giving
- Moral Disipline
- Meditation

Giving serves to break down the egocentric frame of mind on the basisi of which we habitually interact with others. Or as the buddha states "it enobles and adorns the mind"

Moral discipline consisits of five general training rules known as the five precepts, which consists of abstainig from:

- taking life
- stealing
- sexual misconduct
- lying
- the use of intoxicants

There is also a more stringent series of precepts that lay Buddhists undertake for the Uposatha, the observance days determined by the lunar calendar: the full-moon day, the new-moon day, and the two half-moon days. Of the four, in buddhist countries, it is the full-moon day that is given priotity. On these occasions, devout lay Buddhists undertake eight precepts, The additional precepts emulate the training of a novince monk or nun. Other than the usual ones, these include:

- Complete sexual abstinace
- One meal a day, refraining from eating at night
- Abstinince of entertainment, including dancing, singing, music, shows, wearing jewelry, and using collogne
- Using luxurious beds and seats, instead using low resting places, such as small beds or mats

The Uposatha observance regard moral dicsipline as an observance with a training in self restraint, simplicity, and contentment, in this respect they prepare the disciple for the training of the mind undertaken in the practice of of meditation. 

The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to liberation but is a source of merit in its own right. Meditation practices, even those that do not lead directy to insight, help purify the grosser levels of mental defilement and uncover deeper demensions of the minds purity and radiance.
