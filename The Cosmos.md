## The Cosmos 

Greetings traveler! My name is Bryce McAlister. You have happened stumbled across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is essentailly my thinking enviorment. Here, I take a journey through the depths of the universe that is my mind and try to come out with new insights. This is done during the "learning" period of my day ([[🌤 The Day]]). If you wish to navigate The Cosmos, you can do so within my home note [[🫀 The Core]].
