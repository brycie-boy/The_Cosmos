## The Cosmos 

Greetings traveler! My name is Bryce McAlister. You have happened stumbled across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is essentailly my thinking enviorment. Here, take a journey through the vast universe of my mind and try to come out with new insights. This is done during the "learning" period of my day ([[ðŸŒ¤ The Day]]). If you wish to probe my brain and judge me, feel free to do so within my home note [[ðŸ«€ The Core]].
