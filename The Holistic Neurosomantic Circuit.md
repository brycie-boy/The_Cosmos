## The Holistic Neurosomantic Circuit  # 

The Holistic Neurosomantic Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted by estactic experience via biological or chemical yogas, such as the [[The first jhana]], [[The second jhana]], and [[The third jhana]].  It processes neurosomantic ("mind-body") feedback loops, somatic-sensory bliss, feeling "high", "faith-healing", etc. Christian Science, NLP and holistic medicine consist of gimmicks or tricks to get this circuit into action at least temorarily. Tantra yoga is concerned with shifitng consciousness entirley into this circuit.
