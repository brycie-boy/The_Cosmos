The Moral Socio-Sexual Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted by the first orgasm-mating experiences and is conditioned by tribal taboos. It processes sexual pleasure, local definitions of "right" and "wrong", adult-parental personality (sex role), and nurture of the young.
