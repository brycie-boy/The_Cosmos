## The CItadel  # 

The CItadel is a term that the late [[J.B. Priestly]] gave to the scientific-technological elite who both support and are supported by [[The Military Industrial Complex]]. The CItadel, in most countries, gets financed millions of dollars for every few dollars  doled out to the humanities, the social studies, and the arts. It devotes the majority of its time on the task, as [[R. Buckminster Fuller]] would say, of delivering more and more explosive power in greater and greater distances in shorter and shorter amounts of time to kill more and more people. For this reason, the Citadel increasingly frightens us and there is a vast, somewhat inchoherent rebellion against it all around the world. This rebellion usually takes the form of returning to some earlier [[reality tunnel]].
