## 🔮 The Cosmos

Greetings traveler! My name is Bryce McAlister. You have happened stumbled across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is, in short, essentailly my thinking enviorment. It is here that I dive into the depths of the universe that is my mind and attempt to emerge with new insights. This is done during the "learning" period of my daily routine ([[🌤 The Day]]). For an in depth explination of this thinking process, visit  [[☯️ The Flow]]. If you wish to navigate The Cosmos, you can do so through my home note [[🫀 The Core]].
