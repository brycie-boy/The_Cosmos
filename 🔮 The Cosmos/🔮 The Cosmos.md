## 🔮 The Cosmos 

> Per Wiki: “The **cosmos** is another name for the Universe. Using the word _cosmos_ implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity”

Greetings traveler! My name is Bryce McAlister. You have happened to stumble across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is, in short, essentailly my thinking enviroment. It is here that I dive into the depths of the universe that is my mind and attempt to emerge with new insights to share with the world. This is done during the "learning" period of my daily routine ([[🌤 The Day]]). For a more in depth explination of this thinking process, visit  [[☯️ The Flow]]. If you wish to take a step into my mind and to navigate the depths of The Cosmos, you can do so through my home note [[🫀 The Core]].
