## ðŸ”® The Cosmos 

Greetings traveler! My name is Bryce McAlister. You have happened stumbled across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is essentailly my thinking enviorment. Here, I take journeys through the depths of the universe that is my mind and try to come out with new insights. This is done during the "learning" period of my daily routine ([[ðŸŒ¤ The Day]]). If you wish to navigate The Cosmos, you can do so through my home note [[ðŸ«€ The Core]].
