# 🫀 The Core

> Per Wiki: “The **cosmos** is another name for the Universe. Using the word _cosmos_ implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity [as aposed to chaos]”

The Core is the heart of [[🔮 The Cosmos]]. Where all streams flow. It is from here that you shall choose the path in which you wish to embark upon. A vast journey awaits you. Good luck.
