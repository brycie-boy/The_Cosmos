# ☯️ The Flow

_“The Tao of the sage is work without effort”_

The ulitmate goal of [[🔮 The Cosmos]] is to create a stress free and uncontrived learning, thinking, and teaching experience. To accomplish this, i developed The Flow. [[🔮 The Cosmos]] consists of notes which are written and organized to evovle, contribute, and accumulate over time across projects. This is an unsual way to think about writing notes: [[Most peoople take only transient notes]]. The Flow is diametrically apposed to this—this practice is not about writing notes, it is about effectivley accumulating insight: [[Better note taking misses the point; what matters is better thinking]].

The Flow consists of 3 stages:

1. [[Ingestion]]
2. [[Digestion]]
3. [[Egestion]]
