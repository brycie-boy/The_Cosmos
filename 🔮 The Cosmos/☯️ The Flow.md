# ☯️ The Flow

“The Tao of the sage is working without effort”

The goal I have for this learning workflow is to create a frictionless, stress free, and seamless learning and thinking experience.

- no more clinging to ideas in fear of forgetting them
- No more trying it hard to think about something, simply love in to another note
- No more thinking about things through the day, this is reserved for the learning period
- No more worrying about putting things in the right category
- No more worrying about if a note is compete or not because notes are constantly evolving

There are 3 stages to The Flow

1. [[Ingestion]]
2. [[Digestion]]
3. [[Egestion]]
