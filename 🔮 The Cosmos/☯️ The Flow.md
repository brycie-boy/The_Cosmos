# ☯️ The Flow

_“The Tao of the sage is work without effort”_

The goal I have for [[🔮 The Cosmos]] is to create a seamless and stress free learning, thinking, and teaching experience. To accomplish this, i created The Flow.

The Flow consists of 3 stages:

1. [[Ingestion]]
2. [[Digestion]]
3. [[Egestion]]
