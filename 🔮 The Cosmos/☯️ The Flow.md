# ☯️ The Flow

“The Tao of the sage is working without effort”

The goal I have for this learning workflow is to create one that requires no excessive effort, no straining to remember things, no clinging to ideas in fear of forgetting, and also forcing myself to try and think of something. If I can’t develope a note further then I just move on to another one and come back to it later. In short plan to build a stress free and seamless learning and thinking environment.

There are 3 stages to The Flow

1. Ingestion
2. Digestion
3. Egestion

# Ingestion

### Sources

##### 1. Broad Sources

These source types provide a broad context on a topic. These are good for expanding upon with tid bit sources, rather than jumping across tid bit sources and putting them together to understand a topic.

Tid bits can be deliberately sought out to expand upon a specific thing when a broad source isn’t elaborate enough on it. Or  it can be added within an inbox in which sources that seem interesting can be added and managed.

**📚 Books**

**⏯ Lectures**

**👨‍🏫 Courses**

##### 2. Tid Bits

These types of sources are for gaining smaller bits of insight from commentaries on a topic. These can be used for short introductions to topics but shouldn’t have notes taken on them until the broad source types are used.

**🌐 Articles / blogposts / social media posts**


**⏯ Video**

**🎙 Podcasts**

**✏️ Note Pad**

Used when on the go

- Jot down ideas that come to mind
- Jot down things you want to look further into but don’t have the time
- Jot down things I want to write about later

### Annotating System / Note Types
The things listed below are usually what I look for when consuming information. When capturing insights, I’m looking for what can be turned into notes.  I see these things as building blocks for content. Hence why they’re congruent with my notes types.

When capturing annotations, don’t worry about what the best things to annotate are. Instead, as you read, annotate anything that resonates or seems important. It’s better to annotate to much than too little. Later on within the inbox note, annotations will be organized or removed.

# 🔴
##### Red: Points

**Non-fiction**
- Ideas/points
- Arguments
- Facts
- Evidence

**Fiction**
- Important themes
- Plot
	- Conflicts
	- Resolution

# 🔵
##### Blue: Things

**Non-fiction**
- People
- Places
- Things
- Terms

**Fiction**
- Characters
- Settings
- Symbolism

##### Other
- Unknown Words
	- rather than being marked or highlighted, words are written down on a note or sheet of paper
	- Rather than adding random words from a dictionary, add words you come across though things you enjoy. These words will be if more use.
- Correlations
	- If any annotations might correlate with existing notes, jot it down in the annotation notes as a reminder

### The Note Making Process
If my system is called The Cosmos, then, of course, it’s makes sense to liken my notes to the birth of a star. Each idea in my head is a star in the universe that is my mind. 

The process consists of 6 stages, as shown below.


##### 1. ☁️ Stellar Nursery

![[967CE5B9-7A18-4BAF-B85F-888A129B8699.png|300]]
“And the earth was void without form”

The Stellar Nursery is where my inbox notes are stored. All of the annotations from a source go into an  inbox note. The annotations within an inbox note are very atomized; They’re scattered and unrelated. This is the gaseous stage of a note. Within an inbox note, annotations are brought together into cohesive clusters. 

##### 2. ⛅️ Proto

![[05247EF8-7C83-4E59-BB86-FBA95A151ABE.jpeg|300]]
“Then god said let there be be light, and it was so”

The chaos of the Stellar Nursery is beginning to condense. An idea is beginning to emerge from the clouds, but it’s still veiled in ambiguity.

##### 3. ☀️ Main-Sequence

![[8E99C919-531E-4490-BF66-0632708BC7C8.jpeg|300]]

The dust has now cleared and condensed into an clear, distinct, cohesive thought. The note has now evolved into a fully matured star. Capable of spreading its light across The Cosmos. Ultima-notes are densely interconnected, fully fleshed out, permanently useful, distinct ideas.

##### 4. ✨ Constellations 

![[47D219F3-2CEA-45F4-9DDA-BF0E593414D4.webp|300]]

Each note is given tags. Overtime, these tags accumulate notes. Once a tag grows enough, it gets turned into its own note, which I call constellations. Each constellation contains links to each note containing the tag. Constellations provide a map for a subject, sort of like a table of contents, allowing for easier navigation.

##### 5. 🫀 The Core

![[E81AE940-820D-41D1-B048-DE189C84F5D2.jpeg|300]]

The Core is the heart of The Cosmos. Constellations are stored in the Core. The Core gives a birds eye view of The Cosmos, and provides a diving point into what ever section of the Cosmos you want to explore.

### The Principles of a Note
- Titles are declarative and imperative sentences
- Titles act as a abstraction for a note

“As above. So below.”

People usually see zettelkasten as only a writing tool, but I think it can be used for much more. I think zettels are very versatile, and that’s what I love about zettelkasten. Zettels are like building blocks for all content creation, not just writing. Zettels can be egested in the same ways that the original ideas that they derived from were ingested.  I want to create workflows where I can use zettels to make all kinds of content. In that way, I can reach a wide audience.

The process can be thought of like a flower which soaks up the nutrients with its roots and blossoms into a beautiful flower

**Books**
- create outlines with zettels
