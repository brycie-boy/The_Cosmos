# 🌤 The Day

“In order for man to succeed in life, God provided him with two means, wisdom and physical activity. Not separately, one for the soul and the other for the body, but for the two together. With these means, man can attain perfection.” ~ Plato

My day consists of 2 Main sections. Body and mind. Providing my body with addequete exersize allows for my mind to maintain peak performance. Providing my brain with adequette nutrients keeps stress levels down inturn helping my body as well. I find that caring for both aspects are the necessary steps to being the best version of yourself.

I plan each day using both Google Calendar and my[[🗓 Daily Planner]]
