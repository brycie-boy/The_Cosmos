## Insight #🧠 

Insight, when developed, leads to higher wisdom into the true nature of phenomena,  permanently liberates the mind from ignorance of [[The four nobel truths]], and ultimatley leads to the realization of [[Nibbana]]. The cultivation of insight requires skill in observing, investigating, and decerning the nature of conditioned phenomena, or "formations", doing so requires intense concentration through the development of [[Serenity]].
