## Clinging to our personal views of reality destroys the potential for learning new ideas # 

As Persinger and Lafreniere write in Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events, Nelson-Hall, 1977, page 3: We, as a species, exist in a world in which exist a myriad of data points. Upon these matrices of points we superimpose a structure and the world makes sense to us. The pattern of the structure originates within our biological and sociological properties.


To the extent that we remain conscious that [[The external world that we percieve is a only the product of what the brain receives, edits, and classifies]] and that [[Any ideas which we deem certain or factual are only conjectural and inferitial]], then we maintain [[Model Agnosticism]] and and will continue learning throught our lives

To the extent that we become unconscious of this, we will behave Fundamentalistically and Idolatrously and will never again learn anything after we elevate a generalization into dogma and stop thinking. 

If we become fully hypnotized by a [[reality tunnel]] we may even become, in conventional terms, a bit mad. In such a state of mania, we might even burn books, that contain heresy against our idols, or fake data to support our predjudices, or find ourselves compelled to explain increasing amounts of discordant data by accusing vast amorphous conspiracies of having "cooked the data". Or we may even become sincerly convinced that any one who senses inconsistent with out idol must be hallucinating. In such a state, we appear "beyond reasoning," i. e. beyond the normal parameters of social discorse.
