## Clinging to our personal views of reality destroys the potential for learning new ideas # 

As Persinger and Lafreniere write in Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events, Nelson-Hall, 1977, page 3: We, as a species, exist in a world in which exist a myriad of data points. Upon these matrices of points we superimpose a structure and the world makes sense to us. The pattern of the structure originates within our biological and sociological properties.

Clinging to sensual pleasure and material comfort is one trap that keeps beings bound to [[Samsara]]. Another trap is attatchment to views.

To the extent that we remain conscious that [[The external world that we percieve is a only the product of what the brain receives, edits, and classifies]] and that [[Any ideas which we deem certain or factual are only conjectural and inferitial]], then we maintain [[Model Agnosticism]] and and will continue learning throught our lives

but [[We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]] . Attachment to these [[Perception]]s lead to one-sided, biased interpertations of reality that we cling to as accurate and complete.

This is the point of [[The Buddha]]'s famous parable of the blind men and the elephant. In this parable, [[the Buddha]] refers to a king who decided to round up all the blind men in the city. After doing so, the the king asked his servants to show the blind men an elephant. Each man was presented with a different part of the elephant. The king then asked the group of blind men ‚ÄòTell me, blind men, what is an elephant like?‚Äô. Each of the men described the elephant in terms of the part they had been shown. These men, in there certainy, preceded to dispute with and fight with one another each stating ‚ÄúAn elephant is like this, an elephant is not like that!".

To the extent that we become unconscious of this, we will behave Fundamentalistically and Idolatrously and will never again learn anything after we elevate a generalization into dogma and stop thinking. 

If we become fully hypnotized by a [[reality tunnel]] we may even become, in conventional terms, a bit mad. In such a state of mania, we might even burn books, that contain heresy against our idols, or fake data to support our predjudices, or find ourselves compelled to explain increasing amounts of discordant data by accusing vast amorphous conspiracies of having "cooked the data". Or we may even become sincerly convinced that any one who senses inconsistent with out idol must be hallucinating. In such a state, we appear "beyond reasoning," i. e. beyond the normal parameters of social discorse. 

[[Clinging to our personal views of reality gives rise to conflict and disputes]]
