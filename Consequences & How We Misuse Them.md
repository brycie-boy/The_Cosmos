### Annotations

- If you, as parent, are deciding what a consequence is or should be, then it’s not a natural consequence.

- even the possible negative impact on your grade is not a natural consequence, because that’s something the teacher decides.

- Illogical or arbitrary consequences and punishments are the least effective methods.  The thing is, they’re very deceptive, because it looks like they work.  That’s what makes them so appealing and reinforcing to parents.  If you pick up a child and plop them down in a time out chair, then the behavior they were doing will, by definition, be stopped.   We tell them to “think about what they did”, which they do not, because they don’t understand the connection between what they did and sitting in the corner (which might be because there _isn’t_ any connection.)

- It’s not that big a mystery.  They appeal because they’re not as much work (keeping strictly to natural and calmly implemented logical consequences is a lot of work, and demands a lot of self-control.)

- They appeal because it’s what many of us experienced as children, and “we turned out okay” (one of My Top Ten Least Favorite Phrases, right there).

- _They work in the moment._  But, as many parents will tell you, “I’ve told him a thousand times, I’ve put him in the corner every day, but he’s STILL doing it!”  Right.  Because he didn’t learn anything.
