## The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit  # 

The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted by advanced yogas (biochemical-electrical stresses) such as [[The fourth jhana]]. It processes DNA-RNA feedback systems and is "collective" in that it contians and has access to the entire evolutionary "script", past and future. Experience of this Circuit is numinous, "mystical", mind-shattering; here dwell [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Archetypes of the collective unconscious]]. Gods, goddesses, demons, dwarfs, and other personifications of DNA programs (instincts) that govern us.
