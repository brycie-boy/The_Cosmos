## Emic Reality  # 

Emic reality is a term which refers to the unified field made up of all dualistic concepts—ourselves, other beings, material objects, thoughts, [[Sensation]]s, [[Perception]]s, etc. It is the paradigm or model that people create by talking to each other, or by communicating in any symbolism; the culture of a time or place; the semantic enviroment. Every emic reality has its own structure, and imposes structure on raw experience.
