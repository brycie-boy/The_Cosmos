## The jhanas  #🧠 

The jhanas are profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully obsorbed in its object. The Buddha enumerates four jhanas, named simiply after their numerical position in the series, each being more refined that its predecessor.

- The first jhana consists of thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born from seclusion. 
- The second jhana consists of internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.
- The third jhana consists of the fading away of rapture and happiness which comes a feeling of equanimity.
- The fourth jhana consists of the abandoning of pleasure and pain and includes the purification of mindfullness by equanimity.

From the fourth jhana, three lines of development become possible. The first line is the [[The formless attainments]]. The second line is the acquisition of [[Supernormal Knowledge]]. The third line is the knowledge of the distruction of [[The taints]].
