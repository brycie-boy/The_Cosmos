## ⛅️ Proto Note

“And god said let there be light!”

As the dust of the  [[☁️ Nebula]] condenses, an idea begins to emerge from the clouds and take shape. These ideas are not quite complete though, they are still under development. These notes which are under development are what i call proto notes. The goal the proto note is to eventually develop into [[☀️ Main-Sequence Note]]s.

This development process is as follows:

1. **Write broad notes** which capture the big ideas of the clusters within your [[☁️ Nebula]]s

2. **Write finer grained notes:** look through the individual scraps of that cluster. Write notes that capture more nuanced atomic ideas within that cluster.

3. **Connect:** Search for relevant past notes which relate to these new notes. Link, merge,  and revise as necessary to represent your new synthesized conception of those ideas

4. **Revise:** Return to the broad notes and improve your summary based on what you've learned from writing the detailed notes and the detailes you unpacked if its possible to do so without muddying their focus. Remove detailed notes that are no longer necessary. Update others based on what you've learned writing your updated broad note if appropriate.

Proto notes may not always derive from [[☁️ Nebula]]s, they can also start from my own personal thoughts and ideas i have throughout the day which i write on [[A note Pad for sctrach thoughts]].
