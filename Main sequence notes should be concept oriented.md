## Main sequence notes should be concept oriented  #üß† 

When writing notes, its best to write them by concept rather than by book, author, event, project, topic, etc. This way you discover connections across books and domains as you update and link to that note over time. ([[Main sequence notes should be densily linked]])

The most strightforward way to write notes is to start a new note for each book, project or topic. When you read another book which discusses the same topic, you write a new note on that book, in this way, there is no accumulation. Your new notes don't combine with your old thoughts to form a whole. you just have a bunch of scattered notes on a topic. (contra [[Main sequence notes should be atomic]]) Its not just about accumulation. There's no pressure to sythesize your new ideas on the concept with your prior thoughts about it.

Connections tend to appear where they're not quite expected. When arranging notes by concept, you may make suprising links between ideas that came up in very different books. You may have never noticed those books were related before.

Organizing by concept makes note writing a little harder, but in a useful way. When writing new notes, we have to find out where they fit into the whole. So we explore some part of our prior web of notes, which may lead us somewhere unexpected.
