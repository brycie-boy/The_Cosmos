## Dependant Origination  # 

The ultimate purpose of the teaching of dependant origination is to show the conditions that sustain [[Samsara]] and there by show what must be done to gain release from [[Samsara]]. To win deliverance is a matter of unraveling the causal pattern that underlies our bondage, and this begins by understanding the causal process itself. The doctrine is usually expounded as a sequence of twelve factors joined into a chain of eleven propositions. The series is expounded in two ways: the way of origination (forward order) and the way of cessation (reverse order). The sequence is as follows: 

Becuase of (1) ignorance, lack of direct knowledge of [[The four nobel truths]], we engange in [[Wholesome kamma]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]]; these are (2) [[Volitional formations]], in other words, [[Kamma]]. [[Volitional formations]] sustain [[Consciousness]] from one life to the next and determine where it rearises; in this way [[Volitional formations]] condition (3) [[Consciousness]]. Along with consciousness, beginning from the moment of conception, arises [[Mind-and-form]], the constituents of a sentient organism. The sentient organism is equipped with (5) [[Six sense bases]], the five physical sense faculties and the mind as an organ of cognition.
