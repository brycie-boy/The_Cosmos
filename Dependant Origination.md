## Dependant Origination  #üß† 

The ultimate purpose of the teaching of dependant origination is to show the conditions that sustain the round of rebirths and thereby show what must be done to gain release from [[Samsara]]. To win deliverance is a matter of unraveling the causal pattern that underlies our bondage, and this begins by understanding the causal process itself. The doctrine is usually expounded as a sequence of twelve factors joined into a chain of eleven propositions. The series is expounded in two ways: the way of origination (forward order) and the way of cessation (reverse order). The sequence is as follows: 

Becuase of (1) ignorance, lack of direct knowledge of [[The four nobel truths]], we engange in [[Wholesome kamma]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]]; these are (2) [[Volitional formations]], in other words, [[Kamma]]. [[Volitional formations]] sustain [[Consciousness]] from one life to the next and determine where it rearises; in this way [[Volitional formations]] condition (3) [[Consciousness]]. Along with consciousness, beginning from the moment of conception, arises [[Mind-and-form]], the constituents of a sentient organism. The sentient organism is equipped with (5) [[Six sense bases]], the five physical sense faculties and the mind as an organ of cognition. The senses allow for (6) contact between consciousness and its objects, and contact conditions (7) [[Sensation]]. Called into play by [[Sensation]], (8) craving arises, when craving intensefies it gives rise to (9) clinging, a tight attachment to objects of desire through sensuality and wrong views. Impelled by attachments we engange in [[kamma]] pregnant with (10) a new existsance. At death this potential for new exitstance is actualized in a new life beginning with (11) birth and ending with (12) aging and death.

From above, we can see that the twelve factors are spread out over a span of three lives, with ignorance and [[Volitional formations]] pertaining to the past, birth aging and death to the future, and the intermediate factors to the present. The segment from [[consciousness]] through [[Sensation]] is the resultant phase of the present, the phase resulting from past ignorance and [[Kamma]]. The segment from craving to existance is the kammically creative phase of the present, leading to renewed existance in the future. But existence is distinhuished into two different into two phases: one called [[kamma]]-existance, constitutes the active side of existance and belongs to the causal phase of the present life. The other called rebirth-existence, constitutes the passive side of existance and belongs to the resultant phase of the future life. The twelve factors are also distributed into three "rounds": the round of defilements which includes ignorance, craving, anc clinging; the round of action includes [[Volitional formations]] and [[kamma]]-existence; and all other factors belong to the round of results. Defilements give rise to defiled [[Kamma]], [[Kamma]] bring forth results, and results serve as the soil for more defilements. In this way, [[Samsara]] continues without a discernible beginning.

This method of dividing up the factors into three groups does not mean that the past, present, and future factors are mutually exclusive. the distribution into three lives is only a expository decive which, for the sake of cohesion, has to resort to some degree of abstraction. The groups of factors seperated in the formula are inseperably interwoven in their dymanic operation. The formula shows demonstates how rebirth can occur without there being a substantial self that maintains its identity as it transmigrates from one life to the next ([[Identity view]]). Without a self to hold the sequence together, what connects one life to the next is the principle of conditionality. Conditions in one existance initiate the arising of the conditioned phemomena in the next existance. The whole process ends only when its underlying springs. ‚Äîignorance, craving, and clinging‚Äîare extirpated by [[Insight]]. 

[[The Nikayas]] hold dependant origination as a "teaching by the middle". It is a "teaching by the middle" becuase it trandsends two radical views that polarize philosphical reflection on the human condition. These are [[Eternalism]] and [[Annihilationism]]. For [[The Buddha]], both extremes pose insuperable problems. [[Eternalism]] encourages obstanate clinging to [[The five aggregates]]. [[Annihilationism]] threatens to undermine ethics and to make suffering a product of chance. Dependant origination thereby offers a cogent explanation of the problem of suffering that one hand avoids the philosophical dilemmas of a permanent self, and on the other hand avoids the dangers of ethical anarchy to which [[Annihilationism]] eventually leads.
