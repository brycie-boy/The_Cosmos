## Perception #🧠 

Perception is the third of [[The five aggregates]]. It is defined as the interpretation, identification, classification of objects or events by a grasping of their distictive features or charcteristics. Its function is in recognizing and distiguishing meaningful patterns out of what has been previously percieved and creating a label as a condition for percieving again that "this is the same" in order to make sense of the presented information or environment. For example, as [[Fredrich Neitzsche]] puts it, despite there individual differences, in seeing "this leaf" and "that leaf" and "the next leaf", the concept "leaf" is created. The cause and condition for the manifastation of perception is impression between the internal and external [[Six sense bases]].
