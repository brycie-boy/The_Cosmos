## Perception #🧠 

Perception is the third of [[The five aggregates]]. It is defined as the interpretation, identification, classification of objects or events by a grasping of their distictive features or charcteristics. Its function is in recognizing and distiguishing out of our inchoate experience meaningful patterns and in creating a label as a condition for percieving again that "this is the same" in order to make sense of the presented information or environment. For example, as [[Fredrich Neitzsche]] puts it, despite there individual differences, out of "this leaf" and "that leaf" and "the next leaf", the concept of "leaf" is created. The process in which perception developes is explain in detail through [[The five stages of the perception process]]. The cause and condition for the manifastation of perception is impression between the internal and external [[Six sense bases]].
