## The ten pathways of wholesome and unwholsome kamma #🧠 

There are ten types of each class of [[kamma]], also known as the ten pathways of [[Wholesome kamma]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]]. The ten are subdivided into three goups called the "three doors of action", that is, body, speech, and mind. Wholesome kamma is refered to as "righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the [[Dhamma]]" while unwholesome kamma is refered to as “unrighteous conduct, conduct not in accordance with the [[Dhamma]]”

There are three types of bodily misconduct:

- killing
- stealing
- sexual misconduct

There are four types of verbal misconduct:

- lying
- malicious speech
- harsh speech
- gossip

There are three types of mental misconduct; 

- covetousness
- ill will
- wrong view

The ten types of [[Unwholesome kamma]] are the reason why beings are reborn in bad destinations, or a hellish world, after death. The ten types of [[Wholesome kamma]] are the reason why beings are reborn in good destinations, or a heavenly world, after death.
