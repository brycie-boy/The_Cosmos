There are ten types of each class of [[kamma]], also known as the ten pathways of [[Wholesome kamma]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]]. The ten are subdivided into three goups called the "three doors of action", that is, body, speech, and mind. 

There are three types of bodily misconduct:

- killing
- stealing
- sexual misconduct

There are four types of verbal misconduct:

- lying
- malicious speech
- harsh speech
- idle chatter

There are three types of mental misconduct; 

- covetousness
- ill will
- wrong view

The ten types of [[Unwholesome kamma]] are the reason why beings are reborn in bad destinations, or a hellish world, after death. The ten types of [[Wholesome kamma]] are the reason why beings are reborn in good destinations, or a heavenly world, after death.
