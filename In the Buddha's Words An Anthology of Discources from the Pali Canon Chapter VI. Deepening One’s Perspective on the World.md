A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary waystation. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3214
all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of birth and death.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
What lies beyond the round of rebirths is an unconditioned state called Nibbāna.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3808
when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, and to the domain of spirits. But the Blessed One’s disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he attains final Nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the difference, the disparity, the distinction between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, with regard to destination and rebirth.
(AN 4:125; II 128–29)

Nibbāna transcends the conditioned world, yet it can be attained within conditioned existence, in this very life, and experienced as the extinction of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3218
The realization of Nibbāna comes with the blossoming of wisdom and brings perfect peace, untarnished happiness, and the stilling of the mind’s compulsive drives.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3219
Nibbāna is the destruction of thirst, the thirst of craving. 

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3221
To guide his spiritually mature disciples toward Nibbāna, the Buddha had to steer them beyond the blissful rewards that could be won in a future life by performing wholesome deeds. He did so through the “supramundane” facets of his teaching, those aspects designed to lead disciples beyond the “triple world” of sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, and formless existence.

To follow the Buddha in the direction he wants to lead us, we have to learn to see beneath the surface glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception, thought, and views that habitually cloak our vision.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3255
Ordinarily, we represent things to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases. These biases are shaped by our craving and attachments, which they in turn reinforce. We see things that we want to see; we blot out things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, that throw into question our comforting assumptions about ourselves and our lives. To undo this process involves a commitment to truth that is often unsettling, but in the long run proves exhilarating and liberating.

To help us transform our understanding and deepen our perspective on the world, he offers us three standpoints from which we can appraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints also represent three “moments” or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common-sense attitudes and moves strategically toward higher knowledge, enlightenment, and release.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3262
The three moments are: gratification (ass̄da), danger (ādīnava), and escape (nissarạa).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3267 
one begins by recognizing the indubitable fact that such worldly phenomena as sense objects, forms, and feelings give us some degree of gratification. This gratification consists in the pleasure and joy (sukha-somanassa) we experience when we succeed in fulfilling our desires. Once we acknowledge this fact, we can then probe deeper by asking whether such pleasure and joy are entirely satisfactory.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
‘Whatever pleasure and joy there is in the world, this is the gratification in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3270 
If we address this question with utter honesty, in a dispassionate frame of mind, we will realize that such pleasure and joy are far from satisfactory. To the contrary, they are saddled with drawbacks and defects ranging from the trifling to the catastrophic, defects that we perpetually hide from ourselves so that we can continue unhindered in our quest for gratification. This is their danger, the second moment or step of observation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3273
The most pervasive danger lurking behind the innocent façade of our worldly pleasures is their inherent nature of being impermanent (anicca), bound up with suffering and discontent (dukkha), and subject to inevitable change and decay (vipariṇāmadhamma).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
that the world is impermanent, bound up with suffering, and subject to change, this is the danger in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3275
The third moment, the moment of escape,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3279
Once we see that the objects of our attachment are flawed, beset with hidden dangers, we then realize that the way of escape lies in dropping our attachment to them.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
the removal and abandoning of desire and lust for the world, this is the escape from the world.’
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)

sensual pleasures seem to be pleasurable only through a distortion of perception, but when seen rightly are like the fire in a burning charcoal pit—“painful to touch, hot, and scorching.”

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3585
“Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then he might see another leper
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3590
What do you think, Māgandiya? Would that man envy that leper for his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine?” “No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because when there is sickness, there is need for medicine, and when there is no sickness there is no need for medicine.”
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3594
“Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, brought a physician to treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong men would seize him by both arms and drag him toward a burning charcoal pit.
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3601
that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching. For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs,
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3603
his faculties were impaired; thus, though the fire was actually painful to touch, he acquired a mistaken perception of it as pleasant.”
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

= Highlight(pink) - Location 3604
“So too, Māgandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to touch, hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and scorching.
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3606
But these people who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with the fever of sensual pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, though sensual pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken perception of them as pleasant.9
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3609
“Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs,
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3610
the more he scratches the scabs and cauterizes his body, the fouler, more evil-smelling, and more infected the openings of his wounds would become, yet he would find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of his wounds.
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3612
So too, Māgandiya, people who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with the fever of sensual pleasures, still indulge in sensual pleasures; the more they indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned by the fever of sensual pleasures, yet they find a certain measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of sensual pleasure.”
(from MN 75: Māgandiya Sutta; I 504–8)

Buddhist literature frequently advises us to contemplate the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time of its arrival. This recommendation is not made to induce an attitude of chronic morbidity but to help us break our infatuation with life and develop detachment.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3618
“Short is the life of human beings, O brahmins, limited and brief; it is full of suffering, full of tribulation. This one should wisely understand. One should do good and live a pure life; for none who is born can escape death.
(AN 7:70; IV 136–39)

Meditate, monks, do not be negligent, or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you.”

eternalism (sassatav̄da) and annihilationism (ucchedav̄da), also called, respectively, the view of existence (bhavadiṭṭhi) and the view of nonexistence (vibhavadiṭṭhi).

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3328
Eternalism affirms an eternal component in the individual, an indestructible self, and an eternal ground of the world, such as an all-powerful creator God.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3794
Devas and human beings delight in existence,
(It 49; 43–44)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3795
When the Dhamma is taught to them for the cessation of existence, their minds do not enter into it, acquire confidence in it,
(It 49; 43–44)

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3329
Annihilationism denies that there is any survival beyond death, holding that the individual comes to a complete end with the demise of the physical body.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3797
Now some are troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by this very same existence and they rejoice in nonexistence, saying, ‘In as much as this self, good sirs, is annihilated and destroyed with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death, this is peaceful, this is excellent, this is just so!’
(It 49; 43–44)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3331
As we will see below, the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination avoids both these futile ends
