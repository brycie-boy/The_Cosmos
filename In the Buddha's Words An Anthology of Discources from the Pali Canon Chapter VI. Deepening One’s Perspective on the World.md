**A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose** for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary waystation. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.

all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of birth and death.

What lies beyond the round of rebirths is an unconditioned state called **NibbƒÅna**.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
NibbƒÅna transcends the conditioned world, yet it can be attained within conditioned existence, in this very life, and experienced as the extinction of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3218
The realization of NibbƒÅna comes with the blossoming of wisdom and brings perfect peace, untarnished happiness, and the stilling of the mind‚Äôs compulsive drives.

NibbƒÅna is the destruction of thirst, the thirst of craving. It is also the island of safety amid the raging currents of old age, sickness, and death.

To guide his spiritually mature disciples toward NibbƒÅna, the Buddha had to steer them beyond the blissful rewards that could be won in a future life by performing wholesome deeds. He did so through the ‚Äúworld-transcending‚Äù facets of his teaching, those aspects designed to lead disciples beyond the ‚Äútriple world‚Äù of sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, and formless existence.
