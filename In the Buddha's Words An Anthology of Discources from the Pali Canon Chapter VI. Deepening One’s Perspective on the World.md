those inclined to resign themselves to fate that present effort determines our present quality of life as well as our future destiny.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3209
those convinced that personal existence ceases with bodily death that living beings survive the breakup of the body and re-arise in accordance with their kamma.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3211
A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary waystation. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3214
all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of birth and death.

 ___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
What lies beyond the round of rebirths is an unconditioned state called Nibbāna.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
Nibbāna transcends the conditioned world, yet it can be attained within conditioned existence, in this very life, and experienced as the extinction of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3218
The realization of Nibbāna comes with the blossoming of wisdom and brings perfect peace, untarnished happiness, and the stilling of the mind’s compulsive drives.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3219
Nibbāna is the destruction of thirst, the thirst of craving. It is also the island of safety amid the raging currents of old age, sickness, and death.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3221
To guide his spiritually mature disciples toward Nibbāna, the Buddha had to steer them beyond the blissful rewards that could be won in a future life by performing wholesome deeds. He did so through the “supramundane” facets of his teaching, those aspects designed to lead disciples beyond the “triple world” of sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, and formless existence.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3224
the dangers inherent in all conditioned states of being. He sounded a clear warning signal that all states of existence are perilous and fraught with pain. He insisted, unambiguously, that the one hope of lasting security lies in complete purification and liberation of the mind.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3234
Though we sometimes read in the suttas that disciples attained their first experience of awakening merely by listening to the Buddha preach, this does not mean that the Dhamma is easy to understand. Such disciples could penetrate the truth with such apparent ease because their faculties were mature, perhaps too because they had accumulated sufficient supporting conditions from previous lives.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3237
by its very nature, the world-transcending Dhamma goes against the grain of the mundane mind. The Buddha describes the Dhamma as “subtle, deep, and difficult to see,” and one of the things that makes it so difficult to see is its thesis that the highest happiness cannot be won by yielding to the longings of the heart but only by subduing them.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3239
This thesis runs utterly counter to the thought, attitudes, and actions of people fully immersed in the world. As long as we are infatuated with the seductive lures of sensual enjoyment, as long as we take delight in being this or becoming that, we will regard the sublime Dhamma as a mystery and a puzzle.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3253
To follow the Buddha in the direction he wants to lead us, we have to learn to see beneath the surface glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception, thought, and views that habitually cloak our vision.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3255
Ordinarily, we represent things to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases. These biases are shaped by our craving and attachments, which they in turn reinforce. We see things that we want to see; we blot out things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, that throw into question our comforting assumptions about ourselves and our lives. To undo this process involves a commitment to truth that is often unsettling, but in the long run proves exhilarating and liberating.

Craving for sensual pleasures is one trap that keeps beings bound to the round of rebirths. Another major trap is attachment to views.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3320
The most dangerous of wrong views are those that deny or undermine the foundations of ethics.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3321
a number of perils posed by this type of wrong view; prominent among them is rebirth in the lower realms. Views also lead to one-sided, biased interpretations of reality that we cling to as accurate and complete.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3259
To help us transform our understanding and deepen our perspective on the world, he offers us three standpoints from which we can appraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints also represent three “moments” or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common-sense attitudes and moves strategically toward higher knowledge, enlightenment, and release.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3262
The three moments are: gratification (ass̄da), danger (ādīnava), and escape (nissarạa).

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3267
one begins by recognizing the indubitable fact that such worldly phenomena as sense objects, forms, and feelings give us some degree of gratification. This gratification consists in the pleasure and joy (sukha-somanassa) we experience when we succeed in fulfilling our desires. Once we acknowledge this fact, we can then probe deeper by asking whether such pleasure and joy are entirely satisfactory.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
‘Whatever pleasure and joy there is in the world, this is the gratification in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)

___ 

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3270
If we address this question with utter honesty, in a dispassionate frame of mind, we will realize that such pleasure and joy are far from satisfactory. To the contrary, they are saddled with drawbacks and defects ranging from the trifling to the catastrophic, defects that we perpetually hide from ourselves so that we can continue unhindered in our quest for gratification. This is their danger, the second moment or step of observation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3273
The most pervasive danger lurking behind the innocent façade of our worldly pleasures is their inherent nature of being impermanent (anicca), bound up with suffering and discontent (dukkha), and subject to inevitable change and decay (vipariṇāmadhamma).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
that the world is impermanent, bound up with suffering, and subject to change, this is the danger in the world
Note:
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59
That pleasure is impermanent* not world

___

The third moment, the moment of escape,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3276
“Escape” here is not escapism, a word that implies an anxious attempt to avoid facing one’s problems by pretending they don’t exist and losing oneself in distractions. True escape is quite the opposite:

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3279
Once we see that the objects of our attachment are flawed, beset with hidden dangers, we then realize that the way of escape lies in dropping our attachment to them.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
 the removal and abandoning of desire and lust for the world, this is the escape from the world.’
 (AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)

___

Highlight(pink) - Location 3282

The Pāli commentators, not surprisingly, connect these three moments with the Four Noble Truths. “Gratification” implies the second noble truth, for pleasure and joy arouse craving, the origin of suffering. “Danger” is the truth of suffering itself. And “escape” is the truth of the cessation of suffering, which also implies the Noble Eightfold Path, the fourth truth, the way to the cessation of suffering.

___

three major objects of attachment: sensual pleasures, bodily form, and feelings.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3290
“Form” is the physical body.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3291
consider a beautiful young girl. He then traces the progressive stages of her physical decay, through old age, sickness, death, and the eventual disintegration of the corpse until it is reduced to powdered bone.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3292
To show the danger in “feeling,” the Buddha selects the feelings of a meditating monk in the jhānas, the meditative absorptions, the most refined mundane experiences of pleasure and peace. He points out that even these lofty feelings are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3300
sensual pleasures seem to be pleasurable only through a distortion of perception, but when seen rightly are like the fire in a burning charcoal pit—“painful to touch, hot, and scorching.”

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3288
the scope of the examination widens from the personal to the collective, encompassing the broader social and political consequences of this quest. It reaches its climax in striking images of the warfare and human devastation that follow from the frenzied mass drive for sensual gratification.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3323
People who cling tenaciously to their own views of a particular situation often come into conflict with those who view the same situation in a different light. Views thus give rise to conflicts and disputes.

parable of the blind men and the elephant,

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3303
Buddhist literature frequently advises us to contemplate the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time of its arrival. This recommendation is not made to induce an attitude of chronic morbidity but to help us break our infatuation with life and develop detachment.
Note:
this can also help you realize that since death is inevitable, then it’s better to focus on things that don’t bring immediate and intense pleasure but instead benefit you long term satisfaction - this also applies to acknowledging the fleeting nature of short term pleasure

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3306
The Buddha elsewhere says that the recollection of death “when developed and cultivated, gains a foothold in the Deathless and culminates in the Deathless”

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3326
eternalism (sassatav̄da) and annihilationism (ucchedav̄da), also called, respectively, the view of existence (bhavadiṭṭhi) and the view of nonexistence (vibhavadiṭṭhi).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3328
Eternalism affirms an eternal component in the individual, an indestructible self, and an eternal ground of the world, such as an all-powerful creator God.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3329
Annihilationism denies that there is any survival beyond death, holding that the individual comes to a complete end with the demise of the physical body.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3331
As we will see below, the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination avoids both these futile ends

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3333
a particular problem posed by eternalist views. Such views can inspire meditators to attain states of deep meditative bliss, which they interpret as union with a divine reality or realization of an eternal self. From the perspective of the Buddha’s teaching, however, such attainments merely create the karmic potential for rebirth into a realm in which that meditative experience becomes the fundamental condition of consciousness. In other words, the attainment of these states in the human realm generates rebirth into the corresponding planes in the realm of subtle form or the formless realm.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3338
The text cited here shows that certain meditators attain the four “divine abodes” and take rebirth in the corresponding planes of the brahma world, where they might abide even for as long as five hundred great eons. Eventually, however, they must inevitably pass away and may then fall into the unfortunate realms of rebirth.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3341
say the same respectively about realms of rebirth corresponding to the jhānas and the formless attainments.
