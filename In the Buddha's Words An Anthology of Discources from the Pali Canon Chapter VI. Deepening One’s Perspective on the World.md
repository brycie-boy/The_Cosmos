those inclined to resign themselves to fate that present effort determines our present quality of life as well as our future destiny.

those convinced that personal existence ceases with bodily death that living beings survive the breakup of the body and re-arise in accordance with their kamma.

___

A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary waystation. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3214
all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of birth and death.

 ___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
What lies beyond the round of rebirths is an unconditioned state called Nibbāna.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
Nibbāna transcends the conditioned world, yet it can be attained within conditioned existence, in this very life, and experienced as the extinction of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3218
The realization of Nibbāna comes with the blossoming of wisdom and brings perfect peace, untarnished happiness, and the stilling of the mind’s compulsive drives.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3219
Nibbāna is the destruction of thirst, the thirst of craving. It is also the island of safety amid the raging currents of old age, sickness, and death.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3221
To guide his spiritually mature disciples toward Nibbāna, the Buddha had to steer them beyond the blissful rewards that could be won in a future life by performing wholesome deeds. He did so through the “supramundane” facets of his teaching, those aspects designed to lead disciples beyond the “triple world” of sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, and formless existence.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3224
the dangers inherent in all conditioned states of being. He sounded a clear warning signal that all states of existence are perilous and fraught with pain. He insisted, unambiguously, that the one hope of lasting security lies in complete purification and liberation of the mind.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3234
Though we sometimes read in the suttas that disciples attained their first experience of awakening merely by listening to the Buddha preach, this does not mean that the Dhamma is easy to understand. Such disciples could penetrate the truth with such apparent ease because their faculties were mature, perhaps too because they had accumulated sufficient supporting conditions from previous lives.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3237
by its very nature, the world-transcending Dhamma goes against the grain of the mundane mind. The Buddha describes the Dhamma as “subtle, deep, and difficult to see,” and one of the things that makes it so difficult to see is its thesis that the highest happiness cannot be won by yielding to the longings of the heart but only by subduing them.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3239
This thesis runs utterly counter to the thought, attitudes, and actions of people fully immersed in the world. As long as we are infatuated with the seductive lures of sensual enjoyment, as long as we take delight in being this or becoming that, we will regard the sublime Dhamma as a mystery and a puzzle.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3253
To follow the Buddha in the direction he wants to lead us, we have to learn to see beneath the surface glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception, thought, and views that habitually cloak our vision.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3255
Ordinarily, we represent things to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases. These biases are shaped by our craving and attachments, which they in turn reinforce. We see things that we want to see; we blot out things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, that throw into question our comforting assumptions about ourselves and our lives. To undo this process involves a commitment to truth that is often unsettling, but in the long run proves exhilarating and liberating.

- Note: greed hatred delusion

Craving for sensual pleasures is one trap that keeps beings bound to the round of rebirths. Another major trap is attachment to views.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3320
The most dangerous of wrong views are those that deny or undermine the foundations of ethics.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3321
a number of perils posed by this type of wrong view; prominent among them is rebirth in the lower realms. Views also lead to one-sided, biased interpretations of reality that we cling to as accurate and complete.

To help us transform our understanding and deepen our perspective on the world, he offers us three standpoints from which we can appraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints also represent three “moments” or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common-sense attitudes and moves strategically toward higher knowledge, enlightenment, and release.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3262
The three moments are: gratification (ass̄da), danger (ādīnava), and escape (nissarạa).

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3267
one begins by recognizing the indubitable fact that such worldly phenomena as sense objects, forms, and feelings give us some degree of gratification. This gratification consists in the pleasure and joy (sukha-somanassa) we experience when we succeed in fulfilling our desires. Once we acknowledge this fact, we can then probe deeper by asking whether such pleasure and joy are entirely satisfactory.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
‘Whatever pleasure and joy there is in the world, this is the gratification in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)

gratification in the case of sensual pleasures?

five cords of sensual pleasure.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3407
Forms cognizable by the eye

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3408
Sounds cognizable by the ear.…

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3408
Odors cognizable by the nose.…

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3408
Flavors cognizable by the tongue.…

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3408
Tactile objects cognizable by the body

___ 

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3270
If we address this question with utter honesty, in a dispassionate frame of mind, we will realize that such pleasure and joy are far from satisfactory. To the contrary, they are saddled with drawbacks and defects ranging from the trifling to the catastrophic, defects that we perpetually hide from ourselves so that we can continue unhindered in our quest for gratification. This is their danger, the second moment or step of observation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3273
The most pervasive danger lurking behind the innocent façade of our worldly pleasures is their inherent nature of being impermanent (anicca), bound up with suffering and discontent (dukkha), and subject to inevitable change and decay (vipariṇāmadhamma).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
that the world is impermanent, bound up with suffering, and subject to change, this is the danger in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59

- Note: pleasure* not world

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3275
The third moment, the moment of escape,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3276
“Escape” here is not escapism, a word that implies an anxious attempt to avoid facing one’s problems by pretending they don’t exist and losing oneself in distractions. True escape is quite the opposite:

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3279
Once we see that the objects of our attachment are flawed, beset with hidden dangers, we then realize that the way of escape lies in dropping our attachment to them.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
the removal and abandoning of desire and lust for the world, this is the escape from the world.’
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59) 

___

Highlight(pink) - Location 3282

The Pāli commentators, not surprisingly, connect these three moments with the Four Noble Truths. “Gratification” implies the second noble truth, for pleasure and joy arouse craving, the origin of suffering. “Danger” is the truth of suffering itself. And “escape” is the truth of the cessation of suffering, which also implies the Noble Eightfold Path, the fourth truth, the way to the cessation of suffering.

the danger in the case of sensual pleasures?
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90) 

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3412
Here, monks, on account of the craft by which a clansman makes a living—whether checking, accounting, calculating, farming, trading, husbandry, archery, the royal service, or whatever craft it may be—he has to face cold and heat; he is injured by contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creeping things; he risks death by hunger and thirst. Now this is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3416
“If no property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes an effort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘My work is in vain, my effort is fruitless!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3419
“If property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes an effort thus, he experiences pain and grief in protecting it:
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90) 

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3421
as he guards and protects his property, kings or thieves make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweeps it away, or unloved heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘I no longer have my property!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3288
the scope of the examination widens from the personal to the collective, encompassing the broader social and political consequences of this quest. It reaches its climax in striking images of the warfare and human devastation that follow from the frenzied mass drive for sensual gratification.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3425
“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... kings quarrel with kings, khattiyas with khattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders; mother quarrels with son, son with mother, father with son, son with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, brawls, and disputes they attack each other with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3438
“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men break into houses, plunder wealth, commit burglary, ambush highways, seduce others’ wives, and when they are caught, kings have many kinds of torture inflicted on them ... whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)

People who cling tenaciously to their own views of a particular situation often come into conflict with those who view the same situation in a different light. Views thus give rise to conflicts and disputes.

“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... people indulge in misconduct of body, speech, and mind. Having done so, on the breakup of the body, after death, they are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

the danger in the case of form?

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3457
Later on one might see that same woman here at eighty, ninety, or a hundred years, aged, as crooked as a roof bracket, doubled up, supported by a walking stick, tottering, frail, her youth gone, her teeth broken, gray-haired, scanty-haired, bald, wrinkled, with limbs all blotchy.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3459
What do you think, monks? Has her former beauty and loveliness vanished and the danger become evident?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Monks, this is a danger in the case of form.

To show the danger in “feeling,” the Buddha selects the feelings of a meditating monk in the jhānas, the meditative absorptions, the most refined mundane experiences of pleasure and peace. He points out that even these lofty feelings are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and subject to change.

Here, monks, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a monk enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna,

On that occasion he feels only feeling that is free from affliction.
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3486
The highest gratification in the case of feelings is freedom from affliction, I say.

“And what, monks, is the danger in the case of feelings? Feelings are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.

“And what, monks, is the escape in the case of feelings? It is the removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and lust for feelings.

sensual pleasures seem to be pleasurable only through a distortion of perception, but when seen rightly are like the fire in a burning charcoal pit—“painful to touch, hot, and scorching.”

having understood as they really are the origin, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual pleasures,

Buddhist literature frequently advises us to contemplate the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time of its arrival. This recommendation is not made to induce an attitude of chronic morbidity but to help us break our infatuation with life and develop detachment.
Note:
this can also help you realize that since death is inevitable, then it’s better to focus on things that don’t bring immediate and intense pleasure but instead benefit you long term satisfaction - this also applies to acknowledging the fleeting nature of short term pleasure

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3306
The Buddha elsewhere says that the recollection of death “when developed and cultivated, gains a foothold in the Deathless and culminates in the Deathless”

eternalism (sassatav̄da) and annihilationism (ucchedav̄da), also called, respectively, the view of existence (bhavadiṭṭhi) and the view of nonexistence (vibhavadiṭṭhi).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3328
Eternalism affirms an eternal component in the individual, an indestructible self, and an eternal ground of the world, such as an all-powerful creator God.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3329
Annihilationism denies that there is any survival beyond death, holding that the individual comes to a complete end with the demise of the physical body.

As we will see below, the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination avoids both these futile ends

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3333
a particular problem posed by eternalist views. Such views can inspire meditators to attain states of deep meditative bliss, which they interpret as union with a divine reality or realization of an eternal self. From the perspective of the Buddha’s teaching, however, such attainments merely create the karmic potential for rebirth into a realm in which that meditative experience becomes the fundamental condition of consciousness. In other words, the attainment of these states in the human realm generates rebirth into the corresponding planes in the realm of subtle form or the formless realm.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3338
The text cited here shows that certain meditators attain the four “divine abodes” and take rebirth in the corresponding planes of the brahma world, where they might abide even for as long as five hundred great eons. Eventually, however, they must inevitably pass away and may then fall into the unfortunate realms of rebirth.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3341
say the same respectively about realms of rebirth corresponding to the jhānas and the formless attainments.
