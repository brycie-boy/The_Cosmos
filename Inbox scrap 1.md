Introduction

Highlight(pink) - Location 2575

people who hear the Buddha’s teachings and establish faith must still nurture their wholesome qualities with the radiant energy of the Dhamma before their mindstreams become mature enough to attain direct realization.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2579

These benefits, the enhancing conditions for spiritual development in the Dhamma, come about by the acquisition of puñña or “merit,” a word that signifies the capacity of wholesome action to yield beneficial results within the cycle of rebirths.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2581

According to the Buddha’s teaching, the cosmos, with its many realms of sentient existence, is governed at all levels by immutable laws, physical, biological, psychological, and ethical. The process by which sentient beings migrate from one state of existence to another is likewise lawful.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2585

The governing factor in this process, the factor that makes the entire process a lawful one, is a force called kamma

Highlight(pink) - Location 2586

The word “kamma” literally means action, but technically it refers to volitional action. As the Buddha says: “It is volition (cetanā) that I call kamma; for having willed (cetayitvā), one acts by body, speech, and mind.”1

Highlight(pink) - Location 2589

Such volition may remain purely mental, generating mental kamma that occurs as thoughts, plans, and desires; or it may come to expression outwardly through manifest bodily and verbal actions.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2592

all morally determinate volitional actions create a potential to bring forth results (vipāka) or fruits (phala) that correspond to the ethical quality of those actions. This capacity of our deeds to produce the morally appropriate results is what is meant by kamma. Our deeds generate kamma, a potential to produce fruits that correspond to their own intrinsic tendencies. Then, when internal and external conditions are suitable, the kamma ripens and produces the appropriate fruits.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2595

In ripening, the kamma rebounds upon us for good or for harm depending on the moral quality of the original action. This may happen either later in the same life in which the action was done, in the next life, or in some distant future life.2

Highlight(pink) - Location 2599

On the basis of its ethical quality, the Buddha distinguishes kamma into two major categories: the unwholesome (akusala) and the wholesome (kusala).

Highlight(pink) - Location 2600

Unwholesome kamma is action that is spiritually detrimental to the agent, morally reprehensible, and potentially productive of an unfortunate rebirth and painful results.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2602

The criterion for judging an action to be unwholesome is its underlying motives, the “roots” from which it springs. There are three unwholesome roots: greed, hatred, and delusion. From these there arises a wide variety of secondary defilements—states such as anger, hostility, envy, selfishness, arrogance, pride, presumption, and laziness—and from the root defilements and secondary defilements arise defiled actions.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2605

Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that is spiritually beneficial and morally commendable; it is action that ripens in happiness and good fortune.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2606

Its underlying motives are the three wholesome roots: nongreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion, which may be expressed more positively as generosity, loving-kindness, and wisdom.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2607

Whereas actions springing from the unwholesome roots are necessarily bound to the world of repeated birth and death, actions springing from the wholesome roots may be of two kinds, mundane and world-transcending. The mundane (lokiya) wholesome actions have the potential to produce a fortunate rebirth and pleasant results within the round of rebirths. The world-transcending or supramundane (lokuttara) wholesome actions—namely, the kamma generated by developing the Noble Eightfold Path and the other aids to enlightenment—lead to enlightenment and to liberation from the round of rebirths. This is the kamma that dismantles the entire process of karmic causation.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2619

Right view has two aspects, the world-bound or mundane aspect, which pertains to life within the world, and the supramundane or world-transcending aspect,

Highlight(pink) - Location 2621

The world-transcending right view includes an understanding of the Four Noble Truths, dependent origination, and the three marks of impermanence, suffering, and nonself.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2622

For Early Buddhism this world-transcending right view cannot be taken up in isolation from mundane right view. Rather, it presupposes and depends upon the sound support of mundane right view, which means a firm conviction in the validity of the law of kamma and its unfolding through the process of rebirths.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2625

The twin doctrines of kamma and rebirth enable us to see that the world in which we live is, in important respects, an external reflection of the internal cosmos of the mind. This does not mean that the external world can be reduced to a mental projection in the way proposed by certain types of philosophical idealism. However, taken in conjunction, these two doctrines do show that the conditions under which we live closely correspond to the karmic tendencies of our minds.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2628

The reason why a living being is reborn into a particular realm is because in a previous life that being has generated the kamma, or volitional action, that leads to rebirth into that realm. Thus, in the final analysis, all the realms of existence have been formed, fashioned, and sustained by the mental activity of living beings.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2631

“For beings obstructed by ignorance and hindered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture, for consciousness to be established in a new realm of existence—either inferior, middling, or superior”

Highlight(pink) - Location 2632

(AN 3:76; I 223).4

Highlight(pink) - Location 2633

The next selection, Text V,1(2), draws a finer distinction among the types of unwholesome and wholesome kamma. The text enumerates ten primary instances of each class. Here they are called respectively “unrighteous conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma” and “righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma”

Highlight(pink) - Location 2636

they are usually known as the ten pathways of unwholesome and wholesome kamma.5 The ten are subdivided by way of the three “doors of action”—body, speech, and mind.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2638

Taking the unwholesome first, there are three kinds of bodily misconduct: killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct;

Highlight(pink) - Location 2638

four kinds of verbal misconduct: lying, malicious speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter (or gossip);

Highlight(pink) - Location 2639

three kinds of mental misconduct: covetousness, ill will, and wrong view.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2640

The ten courses of wholesome action are their exact opposites:

Highlight(pink) - Location 2641

the ten types of unwholesome kamma are the reason that beings are reborn in the bad destinations after death; the ten types of wholesome kamma are the reason that beings are reborn in the good destinations after death.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2645

The Buddhist cosmos is divided into three broad realms—the sense-sphere realm (kāmadhātu), the form realm (rūpadh̄tu ), and the formless realm (arūpadhātu)—each comprising a range of subsidiary planes.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2647

The sense-sphere realm, our realm, is so called because the beings reborn here are strongly driven by sensual desire.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2648 

The realm is divided into two levels, the bad destinations and the good destinations.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2648

The bad destinations or “states of misery” (apāya) are three in number: the hells, states of intense torment (see MN 129 and 130, not included in this anthology); the animal kingdom; and the sphere of spirits (pettivisaya ), beings afflicted with incessant hunger, thirst, and other sufferings.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2652

The good destinations in the sense-sphere realm are the human world and the six sensual heavenly planes.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2653

The latter are: the devas in the heaven of the Four Great Kings, who are presided over by four powerful devas (namely, the Four Great Kings); the Tāvatiṃsa devas presided over by Sakka, a devotee of the Buddha who is faithful but prone to negligence (see the Sakkasaṃyutta, SN chapter 11); the Yāma devas; the devas of the Tusita heaven, the abode of a bodhisatta before his final birth; the Nimmānaratī devas (“the gods who delight in creating”); and the Paranimmitavasavattī devas (“the gods who control what is created by others”).

Highlight(pink) - Location 2657

In the form realm the grosser types of material form are absent. Its denizens, known as brahmās, enjoy bliss, power, luminosity, and vitality far superior to the beings in the sense-sphere realm.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2659

The form realm consists of sixteen planes. These are the objective counterparts of the four jhānas.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2659

Attainment of the first jhāna leads to rebirth among Brahmā’s assembly, the ministers of Brahmā, and the Mahābrahmās, according to whether it is developed to an inferior, middling, or superior degree.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2661

The second jhāna, attained in the same three degrees, leads respectively to rebirth among the devas of limited radiance, of measureless radiance, and of streaming radiance.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2662

The third jhāna, attained in the same three degrees, leads respectively to rebirth among the devas of limited glory, of measureless glory, and of refulgent glory.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2663

The fourth jhāna ordinarily leads to rebirth among the devas of great fruit, but if developed with a feeling of disgust for perception, it will conduce to rebirth among the “nonpercipient beings,” beings who lack perception.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2665

The form realm also comprises five planes reserved exclusively for the rebirth of nonreturners

Highlight(pink) - Location 2665

called the pure abodes: aviha, atappa, sudassa, sudassī, and akaniṭṭha. In each of the subtle form planes, the lifespan is said to be of enormous duration and to increase significantly with each higher plane.7

Highlight(pink) - Location 2668

In the third realm of existence, material form is nonexistent and bare mental processes exist; hence it is called the formless realm.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2669

This realm consists of four planes, which are the objective counterparts of the four formless meditative attainments, after which they are named: the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2687

merit (puñña), wholesome kamma capable of yielding favorable results within the cycle of rebirths.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2688

Merit produces mundane benefits, such as a good rebirth, wealth, beauty, and success. It also serves as an enhancing condition for supramundane benefits, that is, for attaining the stages along the path to enlightenment. Hence, as seen in Text V,2(1), the Buddha urges his disciples to cultivate merit, referring to his own cultivation of merit over many previous lives as an example.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2690

The Nikāyas concisely organize the types of merit into three “bases of meritorious deeds” (puññakiriyavatthu): giving, moral discipline, and meditation.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2692

In the Indian religious context, the practice of meritorious deeds revolves around faith in certain objects regarded as sacred and spiritually empowering, capable of serving as a support for the acquisition of merit. For followers of the Buddha’s teaching these are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2695

the Buddha is supreme among persons, the Dhamma among teachings, and the Saṅgha among religious communities.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2702

giving serves to break down the egocentric frame of mind on the basis of which we habitually interact with others.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2723

“moral discipline” (sīla),

Highlight(pink) - Location 2724

five precepts, the training rules to abstain from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and the use of intoxicants.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2729

While the Buddha enjoins observance of the five precepts upon lay followers as a full-time obligation, he recommends a more stringent type of moral practice for the uposatha, the observance days determined by the lunar calendar: the full-moon day, the new-moon day, and the two half-moon days. (Of the four, in Buddhist countries today it is the full-moon day that is given priority.) On these occasions, devout lay Buddhists undertake eight precepts: the usual five, but with the third changed to complete sexual abstinence, augmented by three other precepts that emulate the training rules of a novice monk or nun. The eight precepts, enumerated in Text V,4(2), augment the training in sīla as a moral observance with a training in self-restraint, simplicity, and contentment. In this respect they prepare the disciple for the training of the mind undertaken in the practice of meditation, the third base of merit.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2739

“divine abodes” (brahmavih̄ra) or “immeasurable states” (appamaññ̄): the development of loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity, which are to be extended boundlessly to all sentient beings.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2741

loving-kindness (mett̄) is the wish for the welfare and happiness of all beings;

Highlight(pink) - Location 2742

compassion (karuṇā), the feeling of empathy for all those afflicted with suffering;

Highlight(pink) - Location 2742

altruistic joy (muditā), the feeling of happiness at the success and good fortune of others;

Highlight(pink) - Location 2743

equanimity (upekkh̄), a balanced reaction to joy and misery, which protects one from emotional agitation.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2744

These meditations are said to be the means to rebirth in the brahma world;

Highlight(pink) - Location 2745

While the brahmins regarded the brahma world as the highest attainment, for the Buddha it was just one exalted sphere of rebirth.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2746

The concentration arisen from these meditations, however, can also be used as a basis for cultivating the wisdom of insight, and insight culminates in liberation.

IV. The Way to Fortunate Rebirth

Highlight(pink) - Location 2754

(1) Four Kinds of Kamma

Highlight(pink) - Location 2754

four kinds of kamma

Highlight(pink) - Location 2755

“There is dark kamma with dark results; there is bright kamma with bright results; there is kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright results; there is kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neither dark nor bright results, which leads to the destruction of kamma.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2757

“And what, monks, is dark kamma with dark results? Here, monks, someone generates an afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind. Having done so, he is reborn in an afflictive world. When he is reborn in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he experiences an afflictive feeling, extremely painful, as for example the beings in hell experience.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2761

“And what, monks, is bright kamma with bright results? Here, monks, someone generates a non-afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2765

“And what, monks, is dark and bright kamma with dark and bright results? Here, monks, someone generates both an afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind and a non-afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind. Having done so, he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive and non-afflictive.

Highlight(pink) - Location 2769

a mixture and conglomeration of pleasure and pain,

Highlight(pink) - Location 2770

“And what, monks, is kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neither dark nor bright results, which leads to the destruction of kamma? The volition to abandon this dark kamma with dark results, and to abandon the bright kamma with bright results, and to abandon the dark and bright kamma with dark and bright results—this

Highlight(pink) - Location 2787

it is by reason of unrighteous conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, on the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is by reason of righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, on the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”
