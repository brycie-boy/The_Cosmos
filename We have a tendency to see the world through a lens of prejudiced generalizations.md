## We have a tendency to see the world through a lens of prejudiced generalizations  # 

[[Mark Twain]] once remarked that an anti-semite reminded him of a cat he knew who sat on a stove once and never sat on a stove again. "Whats wrong with that?" asked an anti-semite, falling into Twains trap. "The stupid cat never sat on a cold stove either," Twain replied. This illustrates the generalization that mammals are incapable of criticizing or examining there own neural programs of [[Perception]]. To a mammilian animal, some act or event or thing that seemed "bad" once will always seem "bad" and it, or anything that looks like it, will be attacked or fled. Such programs are created by the processes known as [[imprint]]ing and [[Conditioning]]. 

Humans, being mammals themselves, also seem to function largely on [[Imprint]]ing and [[Conditioning]], and mostly share the same mammilian innability to criticize or examine their neurological programs. These mechanical programs interact with a linguistic [[Reality tunnel]] to produce a characteristic vocabulary, from which behavior can often be predicted mechanically. If one hears the language of the Ku Klux Klan, then they might predict how a Black human would be treated by that group. If one hears the language of Radical Feminism, they might predict how a Male human would be regarded by that group. If one hears the language of Fundementalist Materialists, they might predict how a [[Remote viewing]] report will be recieved. Etc.
