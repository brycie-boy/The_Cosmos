## Kamma  #üß†

According to [[The Buddha]]'s teaching, the cosmos, with its many realms of sentient existence, is governed at all levels by immutable laws; physical, biological, physiological, and ethical. The process in which beings migrate from one existance to another is likewise lawful. It is regulated by a law which works in two principal ways: First, it connects our actions with a paticular realm of rebirth that corresponds to our actions; and second, it determines the relations between our actions and the quality of our experience within the paricular realm we have been reborn. The governing factor in this process, the factor that makes the entire process a lawful one, is a force called kamma.

The word kamma translates literally to "action", but it specifically refers to volitional action, As [[The Buddha]] says: ‚ÄúIt is volition that I call kamma; for having willed, one acts by body, speech, and mind.‚Äù Kamma thus denotes that deeds originate from volition. Such volition may remain purley mental generating mental kamma that occurs as thoughts, plans, and desires; or it may externalize as bodily and verbal actions. Now It may seem that our deeds, once performed, perish and vanish without leaving behind any traces apart from their immediate visible impact on other people and the enviroment. However, accoring to [[The Buddha]], no deed is isolated. All volitional actions immedietly kick off a series of causes and effects and create a potential to bring forth results, or "fruits", that correspond to the ethical quality of that action. This capacity of our deeds to produce the morally appropriate results is what is meant by _kamma_. Our deeds generate kamma, a potential to produce fruits that correspond to their own intrinsic tendencies. Then, when the internal and external conditions are suitable, the kamma ripens and produces the appropriate fruits. in ripening, the kamma rebounds upon us for good or for harm depending on the ethical quality of the original action. This may happen either later in the same life in which the action is done, in the next life, or in some distant future life. 

On the basis of ethical quality, the Buddha distinguishes kamma into two categories: [[Wholesome kamma]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]]
