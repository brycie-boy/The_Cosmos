## Kamma  #üß†

The word kamma translates literally to "action", but it specifically refers to volitional action, As the Buddha says: ‚ÄúIt is volition that I call kamma; for having willed, one acts by body, speech, and mind.‚Äù Such volition may remain purley mental generating mental kamma in the form of thoughts, plans, and desires; or it may externalize as bodily and verbal actions.

All volitional actions create the potential to bring forth results, or "fruits", that correspond to the ethical quality of that action. This capacity of our deeds to produce the morally appropriate results is what is meant by kamma. Our deeds generate kamma, a potential to produce fruits that correspond to their own intrinsic tendencies. Then, when the internal and external conditions are suitable, the kamma ripens and produces the appropriate fruits. in ripening, the kamma rebounds upon us for good or for harm depending on the ethical quality of the original action. This may happen either later in the same life in which the action is done, in the next life, or in some distant future life.
