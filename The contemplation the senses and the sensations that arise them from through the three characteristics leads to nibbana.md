## The contemplation the senses and the sensations that arise them from through the three characteristics leads to nibbana #üß† 

In one of his earliest discources popularly known as "The Fire Sermon", [[The Buddha]] declared that "all is burning". The "all" is the internal [[six sense bases]], their corresponding objects, the types of [[consciousness]] arisen from them, the related contacts, and the following [[Sensation]]s arisen from them. The way to [[Nibbana]] is to see that this "all" is burning with [[The three unwholesome roots]] and dissatisfaction. To dispell ignorance and generate true knowledge, we must contemplate the senses and the [[Sensation]]s that arises them from through [[The three characteristics]]. This, according to [[The Nikayas]], is the direct way to the realization of [[Nibbana]].
