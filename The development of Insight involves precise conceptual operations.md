## The development of Insight involves precise conceptual operations  #

In the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, [[Insight]] is not bare intuition, but a careful, descrimitive understanding that at certain stages involves precise conceptual operations. [[Insight]] is directed to specific domains of understanding. These domains, known in the Pali commentaries as "the soil of wisdom", must be thuroughly investigated and understood through [[conceptual understanding]] before direct, non conceptual [[Insight]] can effectively accomplish his work. To master them requires analysis, discrimination, and dicernment. One must be able to abstract from the overwhelming mass of facts certain basic patterns fundemental to all experience and use these patterns as templates for contemplation of ones own experience.
