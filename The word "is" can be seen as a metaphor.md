## The word "is" can be seen as a metaphor  # 

In seeing that [[language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]], consider the word "is" in the sense of Aristotelean identification ‚Äî as in A is a B. This appears very useful mathematically, because numbers of a mathematical set exist abstractly, but what about when the word as applied to sensory-sensual events? Consider pronouncements such as "this _is_ a great work of art," "this _is_ meaningless drivel," "this _is_ Communism," "this _is_ facism," "this _is_ sexism." When we consider that [[any ideas which we deem certain or factual are only conjectural and inferitial]], such statements should be a bit more complicated‚Äîe.g. "this seems like a great work of art to me," this seems like meaningless drivel to me," "this seems like Communism to me," "this seems like facism to me," "this seems like sexism to me."

Of course, when this is pointed out, people will say that the latter formulations are what they really mean and that the Aristotelean "is" was only used for convenience or brevity. But if you observe such people carefully, you will notice that language does indeed have hipnotic effects, and that one who had said "this _is_ sacred" will treat something as if it really is sacred, and those who say "this _is_ crap" will  really treat something as if it really were crap.
