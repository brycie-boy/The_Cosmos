## Thoughts on external validation and self reliance  # 


- befriending yourself
- Keeping yourself company

Tho I sought approval, i was never able to sacrifice my own interests and passions. So my approach for approval was kind of backwards from what I usually see. Instead of changing myself to please others, I seemed to want to change others to please myself. 

One day, out of culminating frustration I guess, I realized that all the time that I was wasting trying to gain approval from others could be directed towards my own self improvement. I saw that I would be much more fulfilled if 

I also questioned why it mattered wether other people liked what I liked or not. It’s not like my interests are any more enjoyable to myself when another person likes them as well. I realized that all that really mattered was what I was interested in and no other opinion was necessary. 

I realized that the only approval that mattered was the approval towards myself.

We grow up these days constantly being told what we should and shouldn’t do. We’re always being 

By our so called superiors, or so they claim, and we’re always being told by them that we could always do better. Nothing is ever good enough.

You can’t be self reliant until you can befriend yourself

Finding friendship is actually paradoxical. It’s not about your social skills, or your body language, or any of that crap. What really matters is makes you stand out. If you are interesting and insightful you’re going to be of much more value to other people and people will want to be around you. You’ll never develop these skills of you spend all your time chasing approval. These aspects are developed in solitude.

Self friendship gives you the ultimate confidence because your confidence is not based on chance, that is, of wether or not others will accept you.

Genuine friendship is not sought after and has no attachment involved. It is effortless and arises spontaneously out of pure interest in one another. As we grow as people our interests may begin to differ and friendships naturally drift. During these instances there may be periods of time we may have to experience a degree of solitude. People only reminisce when they are dissatisfied with themselves. If one is satisfied with themselves then it makes no difference. If friendship is forced, then it is not out of genuine interest but generally has alterior purposes.

To befriend yourself takes self exploitation, a task which one must do alone. One must discover what they value personally without the influence of others.
