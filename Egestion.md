# Egestion

- Add workflows

“As above. So below.”

Eventually, my stars must leave my system and burst into the minds of others. Using the fertilizer of my output, they too will create there own stars.

Rather than using zettelkasten exclusively as a writing tool. I use it as a tool to express my thoughts through any medium. In this way, it can be seen that the ideas leave my mind the same ways they came in. 

Here are some of my outputs with their respective workflows:

**Books**
- create outlines with notes

**Video / Audio / Teaching**

- create scripts or bullet notes with notes

**Spaced Repetition Flashcards**

- Import completed notes into neuracache

With notes being units of knowledge, they can be seen as building blocks for my projects. Creating not only a frictionless learning experience, but a frictionless output experience as well.
