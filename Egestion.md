# 📤 Egestion

- Add workflows

“As above. So below.”

Eventually, my stars, or [[☀️ Main-Sequence Note]]s, must leave my system and burst into the universe of others. Using my output as the fertilizer, they too will create there own stars, and the cycle repeats.

Rather than using zettelkasten exclusively as a writing tool. I use it as a tool to express my thoughts through any medium. In this way, it can be seen that the ideas leave my mind the same ways they came in. 

Here are some of my outputs with their respective workflows:

**Video / Audio / Teaching**

- create scripts or bullet notes with notes
- Rely on my memorization

**Blog Posts**



**Books**

- To express a large complex interrelated concept I would write a book about it
- create outlines with notes
