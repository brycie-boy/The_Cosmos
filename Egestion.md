# 📤 Egestion

- Add workflows

“As above. So below.”

Eventually, my stars must leave my system and burst into the minds of others. Using my output as the fertilizer, they too will create there own stars.

Rather than using zettelkasten exclusively as a writing tool. I use it as a tool to express my thoughts through any medium. In this way, it can be seen that the ideas leave my mind the same ways they came in. 

Here are some of my outputs with their respective workflows:

**Video / Audio / Teaching**

- create scripts or bullet notes with notes
- Rely on my memorization

**Blog Posts**



**Books**

- To express a large complex interrelated concept I would write a book about it
- create outlines with notes

With notes being units of knowledge, they can be seen as building blocks for my projects. Creating not only a seamless learning experience, but a seamless  output experience as well.

I only want to express things that haven’t been expressed before, or haven’t been expressed as well. Zettelkasten is perfect for this because it’s all about making connections and creating new insight
