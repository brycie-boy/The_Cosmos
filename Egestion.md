# Egestion

“As above. So below.”

People usually see zettelkasten as only a writing tool, but I think it can be used for much more. I think zettels are very versatile, and that’s what I love about zettelkasten. Zettels are like building blocks for all content creation, not just writing. Zettels can be egested in the same ways that the original ideas that they derived from were ingested.  I want to create workflows where I can use zettels to make all kinds of content. In that way, I can reach a wide audience.

The process can be thought of like a flower which soaks up the nutrients with its roots and blossoms into a beautiful flower
