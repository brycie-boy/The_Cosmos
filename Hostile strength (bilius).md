## Hostile strength (bilius) #üß† 

The hostile strength type (the tyrant) is one of [[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]]. It is a combination of the imprints of advance and domination. Hostile strength is inclined to paranoid withdrawl: he must govern, but he is also afraid. In the terminology of the medieval psychology of the four humors, this type is known as the bilius humor. The bilius humor was identified with the Eagle archetype and [[The air element]], air probably means sky, becuase these types seem "high and mighty". The [[Transactional Analysis]] system categorizes this type with the life script of "im okay, you're not okay".
