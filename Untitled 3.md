## Consciousness is conditioned and transient  # 

- Daniel Ingram non duality map* bahiya sutta

Many philosophies and doctrines see [[consciousness]] as a self enclosed, unchanging entity which is separate and independent from what is perceived. It is often referred to as the “watcher” or “witness”, thus percieving  consciousness though [[Identity view]]. [[Consciousness]], as [[The Buddha]] demonstrates, arises via contact between the internal and external [[Six sense bases]]. Since the external sense bases can be represented by [[The three characteristics]], the internal bases are constantly making contact with new objects. Thus, [[Consciousness]] is far from static, but is in constantly changing and trasnforming from moment to moment. The monk [[ Ananda]] also demonstrates in a discourse with another monk named  [[Udayi]] since the arising of consciousness is dependently conditioned though contact between the internal and external [[Six sense bases]], if one or the other were to completely cease, then consciousness would not be able to be discerned.
