Many philosophies and doctrines see [[consciousness]] as a self enclosed, unchanging entity which is separate and independent from what is perceived. It is often referred to as the “watcher” or “witness”. [[Consciousness]], as [[The Buddha]] demonstrates, arises via contact between the internal and external [[Six sense bases]]. First, the external [[Six sense bases]] are transient; second, the internal [[Six sense bases]] are constantly making contact with new objects. Thus, [[consciousness]] is far from static, but Is in a constant state of change. [[The Buddha]] also proposes that if the internal or external [[Six sense bases]] were to cease, then consciousness too would cease. 

This is also supported by the idea that [[The brain can be seen as an electro-collodial computer]].
