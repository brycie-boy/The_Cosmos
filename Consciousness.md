## Consciousness  #🧠 

According to wikipedia: "**Consciousness**, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal and external existence". Many philosophies and doctrines see consciousness as a self enclosed entity which is untouched by the mind and sits in the background of experience observing from the inside out. In contrast, consciousness, in Buddhism, is one of [[The five aggregates]], and is defined as cognition arisen through any of the internal [[Six sense bases]]. The cause and condition for the manifestation of consciousness is [[Mind-and-form]]. Since the [[Six sense bases]] are constantly making contact with new objects, consciousness is thereby dynamic and constantly changing. [[The Buddha]] proposes that if the internal or external [[Six sense bases]] were to cease, then consciousness too would cease. [[Mind-and-form]] is also subject to origination and vanishing. Consciousness can thus be seen through [[The three characteristics]], dispelling [[Identity view]] in accordance with consciousness. This is also supported by the idea that [[The brain can be seen as an electro-collodial computer]].
