## Consciousness  #🧠 

According to wikipedia: **Consciousness**, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal and external existence. Many philosophies and doctrines see consciousness as an enclosed entity in and of itself which is untouched by the mind and sits in the background of experience observing from the inside out. 

Consciousness, one of [[The five aggregates]], is defined as cognition arisen through any of the internal [[Six sense bases]].  The cause and condition for the manifestation of consciousness is [[Mind-and-form]].
