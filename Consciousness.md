## Consciousness  #🧠 

Consciousness, one of [[The five aggregates]], is defined as cognition arisen through any of the internal [[Six sense bases]]. The cause and condition for the manifestation of consciousness is [[Mind-and-form]]. Consciousness, rather than recognizing an object, is only a sort of awareness—awareness of the presence of an object. When the eye comes in contact with a colour, for instance blue, visual consciousness arises which simply is awareness of the presence of a colour; but it does not recognize that it is blue. There is no recognition at this stage. It is the third aggregate [[perception]] that recognizes that it is blue. The term ‘visual consciousness’ is a philosophical expression denoting the same idea as is conveyed by the ordinary word ‘seeing’. Seeing does not mean recognizing. So are the other forms of consciousness.
