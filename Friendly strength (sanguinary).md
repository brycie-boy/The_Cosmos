## Friendly strength (sanguinary) #üß† 

The friendly strength type (the good parent) is one of [[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]]. It is a combination of the imprints of advance and submission. In the terminology of the medieval psychology of the four humors, this type is known as the sanguinary humor. The sanguinary humor was identified with the Lion archytype and [[The fire element]]. The Lion archetype becuase the dignity of these big cats represents the "good" strength, and fire represents power. The [[Transactional Analysis]] system categorizes this type with the life script of "im okay, you're okay"
