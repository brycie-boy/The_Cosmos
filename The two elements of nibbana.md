## The two elements of nibbana  # 

[[The Nikayas]] speak of two "elements of [[nibbana]]". The [[Nibbana]] element with residue remaining and the [[Nibbana]] element without residue remaining, The [[Nibbana]] element with residue remaining is described as the destruction of [[The three unwholesome roots]] while the [[Arahant]] is still alive. the "residue" is the composite of [[The five aggregates]] that was brought into being by the ignorance and craving from the previous life and that must continue on until the end of the lifespan. As for the [[Nibbana]] element without residue remaining, it is described as the passing away of the [[arahant]] in which afterwords all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right there. Since there is no more clinging to [[The five aggregates]] and no more craving for a new existence with a fresh set of aggregates, the occurance of the aggregates comes to an end and cannot continue, the process of the aggregates is extinguished (the literal meaning of [[nibbana]]).

[[the Buddha]], however, says nothing at all in terms of exitstence or nonexistence, the condition of the [[Arahant]] after death. It might seem logical that [[The five aggregates]] completely cease with the attainment of the [[Nibbana]] element without residue. The element itself must be a state of complete nonexistance, a state of nothingness. Yet no text within [[The Nikayas]] ever states this. To the contrary, they often refer to [[Nibbana]] in terms of actualities. It is an element, a base, a reality, a state, and so on.
