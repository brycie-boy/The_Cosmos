## The Leary Interpersonal Grid  # 

[[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]] are not meant to be rigid or to imply that there are only four possible types of humanoid robots. The later circuits of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]] can modify all this considerably. Some imprints are wobbly‚Äîthey cover two or more quadrants simultaniously; and were all capable of sudden brain change. It is important to understand that the four archetypes are for convience only. Each quadrant can be subdivided much more sharply if necessary for diagnostic purposes. For instance, an influental psychological test, The Leary Interpersonal Grid, divides the four quadrants into sixteen sub-quadrants and allows one to grade each in terms of moderate to ecxessive tendancy to behave that way. In the grid in which Leary's catagories are drawn, the moderate imprints are in toward the center and the exessive and extreme cases are out toward the perimeter, but what is being measured is still the way the first two circuits, [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and [[The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] , are imprinted.
