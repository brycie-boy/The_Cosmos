## The Leary Interpersonal Grid  #üß† 

[[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]] are not meant to be rigid or to imply that there are only four possible types of humanoid robots. The later circuits of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]] can modify all this considerably. Some [[Imprint]]s are wobbly‚Äîthey cover two or more quadrants simultaniously; and we're all capable of sudden brain change. It is important to understand that the four archetypes are for convience only. Each quadrant can be subdivided much more sharply if necessary for diagnostic purposes. For instance, an influental psychological test, The Leary Interpersonal Grid, divides the four quadrants into sixteen sub-quadrants and allows one to grade each in terms of moderate to excessive tendancy to behave that way. In the grid in which Leary's catagories are drawn, the moderate [[imprint]]s are in toward the center and the excessive and extreme cases are out toward the perimeter, but what is being measured is still the way the first two circuits, the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and the [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] , are [[imprint]]ed.

The [[Irony]] and [[Tragedy]] of human life is that none of these four types are aware at all of their robotry. Each will explain to you, and great length with great conviction, why each of these robotic, endlessly repeating reflexes are caused by the situations around them, i.e., by the "bad" behavior of other people. [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]].
