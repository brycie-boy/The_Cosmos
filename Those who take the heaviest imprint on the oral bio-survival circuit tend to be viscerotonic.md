## Those who take the heaviest imprint on the oral bio-survival circuit tend to be viscerotonic  # 

In extreme cases—those who take the heaviest imprint on [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] tend to be viscerotonic, because the imprint determines life long endoncrine and glandular processes. Thus, these indivduals tend to be "baby faced' in adult life, never lose their "baby fat", are plump, round, gentle, etc. They are easily "hurt" (threatened:terrified) by disapproval of any sort, because in the baby-circuit brain, disapproval suggests extinction by potential loss of food supply.
