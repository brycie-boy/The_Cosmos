An imprint on the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] determines life long endocrine and glandular processes. Thus, in extreme cases, those who take the heaviest imprint on this circuit tend to be viscerotonic. They are "baby faced" in adult life, never lose their "baby fat", are plump, round, gentle, etc. They are easily "hurt" (threatened:terrified) by dissapproval of any sort, because in the baby-brain circuit, disapproval suggests exitiction by potential loss of food supply.
