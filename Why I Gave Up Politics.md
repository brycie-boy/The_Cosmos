One thing of learned through out my life were there short comings of fear based teaching. When people are taught what to do through fear, they don’t actually learn why what they do is bad or good. Their ideas of good and bad are just arbitrary. They only do things because they fear punishment from others. 

This is precisely what politics is about. Politics is not about morality, it about passing laws and laws force people to do things against there own will. Since this is the case, most people who vote are not driven by morality. If they were, they wouldn’t be forcing people to do things.

but through things like there own personal fear or greed. So People have ideas and rules in which they wish to impose upon others for the sake of there personal goals. The “greater good” is used as an excuse for this, as if the individual knows what is best for the entire collective.

___

Laws are a poor place to base your values on. Politics doesn’t teach ethics or reasoning. It only teaches laws. Laws teach you what you have to do, not what you should do. It doesn’t teach the reasoning behind why you should follow these guidelines. law only says that you should do it or else. Your morals would be based on fear, not understanding. When people base there morals and values on law, they’re easily manipulated because they don’t really understand why they do what they do 

Things like philosophy and psychology actually teach these things. They talk about how the world works and how people work,  or why they do the things they do. Through this you can establish your values. And any moral guidelines they provide actually have reasoning behind them

People have to start looking internally for answers rather than externally. As long as people are rotten on the inside, every system will eventually be corrupted. There’s no perfect political system that will fix everything as long as force is involved. 

Fear based teaching only suppresses desires, it does not iradicate them. This is why people become rebellious. Eventually theyll come out one way or another, though psychotaic breaks, riots, etc. the only way to do this is to remove the motivation to do these things in the first place. that is done through learning the consequances of your actions. 

___

If people genuinely understood consequances and respected each other then there really wouldn’t be a point in laws. People would have no compulsion to steal reason to kill, steal, etc. If we should be trying to understand anything it should be each other rather than teaching them what political system they should support. 

When we lock people up in jail, or anything else, people don’t actually get to witness the actual consequences of their actions. People face the consequences of there actions through natural causes. What goes around comes around. Maybe we should leave the judging up to nature rather than taking it on ourselves. Nature always balances things. When we intervene with these process, are we not saying we know better than nature?

___

With democracy, I feel like it gives you the illusion of choice, because if your in a political minority, then it’s pointless to vote. You’re vote will always be vastly outweighed by the majority 



People vote for certain systems because they want others to be forced to do things because they’re want to feel a sense of safety. Yes most votes are emotional, not logical. The person who usually gets elected on the one who gets the most funding because they have the most widespread and effective advertising. In order to really make a difference politically you’d have to have a lot of money.

I’ve realized that I have no control over any worldly affairs and I’m better off using the time I worry about politics on focusing on my own self improvement, which os something I actually can control. I think I should only care about anything political when it directly interferes with something I’m trying to accomplish, which the majority of the time it isn’t. Im better off making the best out of the political state of the world rather than trying to change it in anyway.
