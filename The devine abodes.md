# The devine abodes #üß† 

The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to [[Nibbana]] but is a also a source of [[Merit]]. Meditation practices, even those that do not lead directy to [[Insight]], help purify the grosser levels of mental defilement and uncover deeper demensions of the minds purity and radiance. There are four meditations that produce mundane [[Merit]] refered to by [[the Buddha]] as the "devine abodes" or "immesurable states". these include:

- lovng-kindness: the wish for the welfare and happiness of all living beings
- compassion: a feeling of empathy for all those afflicted with suffering
- altruistic joy: The feeling of happiness for the success and good fortune of others
- equanimity: a balanced reaction to joy and misery which protects one from agitation

The most fruitful of these being loving-kindness. 

These meditations are said to bring rebirth in the [[Brahma World]]. While the Brahmins regarded the [[Brahma World]] as the highest attainment, for [[the Buddha]] it was just one exhalted sphere of rebirth.
