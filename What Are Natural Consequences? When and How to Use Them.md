### Annotations

- Natural consequences help kidsÂ [learn to make good choices](https://www.verywellfamily.com/list-of-consequences-for-bad-behavior-3867837). For instance, if a child is told to put away their sidewalk chalk but leaves it outside during a rainstorm, a natural consequence would be that it gets all wet (or it might get stolen). If a child is reminded to bring a sweater to school but doesn't, they might be chilly in their cold classrooms.

- As a parent, it's tempting to just put away your child's chalk for them or rush in with the sweater. But if you do so, your child won't learn the powerful lessons that natural consequences can teach.

- The great thing about instilling natural consequences is you don't have to do much to let them work their magic. Instead, you basically just have to get out of the way and let your child experience the ramifications of their misstepsâ€”as long as it's safe to do so.

- While it's hard to let your child feel these things, the point is for them to learn from these experiences.

- **What Are Natural Consequences?**

- Essentially, natural consequences are simply what happens as a result of a person's actions, without any intervention by an outside party.

- In fact, the key to using natural consequences with kids is for the parent to step aside and allow their child to experience the effect of their what they've done or not done, saysÂ [Aliza Pressman](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/aliza-w-pressman), PhD, an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics and psychologist at Mount Sinai Kravis Childrenâ€™s Hospital in New York City.

- By not intervening when a child makes a misstep, the parent lets the child learn by doing, truly experiencing the fruits of their labors, explains Dr. Pressman.

- "Natural consequencesÂ are things that happen automatically as a result of a childâ€™s action or inaction without any purposeful behavior on the adultâ€™s part," says Dr. Fulton.

- "If the natural consequence is unwanted or unpleasant, the child has the opportunity to learn from the experience and do things differently the next time to avoid the unpleasant experience."

- **Benefits of Natural Consequences**

- **Fosters Intrinsic Motivation**

- When parents routinely rush in to do things for their kids and/or "rescue" them from their actions (or inaction), they are robbed of developing motivation to take care of their own needs. "Natural consequences can help children to develop intrinsic motivation for behaving in adaptive ways," says Dr. Fulton. If they know you won't automatically fix it if they fail to do what is expected, they will become much more likely to do what needs to be done themself.

- When a child finishes their book report because you hounded them to do it, that's external motivation. If they do it on their own because they want to get a good grade or for the satisfaction of getting their work done, that's intrinsic motivation. Natural consequences help to build this type of internal willpower that will serve kids well in the future, says Dr. Pressman.

- **Develops Autonomy**

- Natural consequences help kids toÂ [become more independent](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-to-teach-your-kids-to-be-more-independent-4779863)Â and self-assured. "They help children to assume responsibility and to learn about how they can control outcomes through their own actions," explains Dr. Fulton. After experiencing an unpleasant natural consequence the child can use the learned information the next time the situation occurs. Behavior may change once the child understands and experiences the unwanted outcome."

- **Teaches Cause and Effect**

- When you use natural consequences, the goal is not simply the discomfort the child may experience, but rather that they develop an understanding of cause and effect, can make predictions, and are able to understand their own ability to impact their environment, says Dr. Fulton.

- If you spare kids from experiencing natural consequences, as parents may feel compelled to do at times, they are robbed of making the connection between their actions and what happens due to their actions.

- As a result, they'll see that they have the agency to impact what happens in their lifeâ€”negatively and positively. 

- Additionally, instead of the child doing something (say putting on a coat) because their parent tells them to, they learn to do it because of the desired result (not being chilly when it's cold outside).

- **Cultivates Resilience**

- When kids are allowed to have natural consequences for their actions, they may be likely to have some adverse experiences, says Dr. Pressman. However, the plus side is that they get the chance to grow and learn from these situations. As a result, you can help them work on theirÂ [coping skills, problem-solving skills, and resilience](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-parents-can-teach-kids-grit-4126106).

- For example, if they forgot to go to theirÂ [best friend](https://www.verywellfamily.com/do-kids-need-a-best-friend-5186953)'s birthday party or to bring aÂ [birthday present](https://www.verywellfamily.com/active-birthday-parties-for-kids-1257350), those missteps mayÂ [impact the friendship](https://www.verywellfamily.com/making-and-keeping-friends-2633627). However, by offering support, you can guide them on how to repair the friendshipâ€”and how to do better next time. They will need to cope with a friend being upset with them or with the disappointment of missing a social event.

- If they miss the deadline for signing up for a school club, they may miss out on that opportunity. Living with the consequences of their actions helps to motivate them to be more responsible and proactive next time. This gives them the chance toÂ [cope with a manageable disappointment](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-to-teach-kids-about-feelings-1095012)Â and/or to take action to rectify the situation, says Dr. Pressman. This type of experience may cultivate resilience that they can draw from when other unfortunate things happen down the road.

- Opportunities for natural consequences come up often, just be sure to only use them when it's safe andÂ [developmentally appropriate](https://www.verywellfamily.com/child-development-overview-4172261). Often, they work best with older children, but can also be effective with younger kids as long as doing so is safe and they are old enough to understand the impact of their choices, says Dr. Pressman.

- **When to Use Natural Consequences**

- Opportunities for natural consequences come up often, just be sure to only use them when it's safe andÂ [developmentally appropriate](https://www.verywellfamily.com/child-development-overview-4172261). Often, they work best with older children, but can also be effective with younger kids as long as doing so is safe and they are old enough to understand the impact of their choices, says Dr. Pressman.

- "If you find yourself tempted to intervene on something your child is responsible for or to stop them from doing something, it might be a good time to consider what the natural consequence would be if you didnâ€™t act. If the result is unpleasant, but not harmful or dangerous, it is likely an opportunity for the child to experience and learn from a natural consequence," says Dr. Fulton

- It's important to skip any "I told you so's" when using natural consequences. "Natural consequences will be most effective when the adult allows it to happen without adding insult or judgment. Parents are often tempted to say something to the effect of, 'See?' or 'Look what you did.' Instead, itâ€™s most helpful to be nonchalant but empathic in responding," says Dr. Fulton.
