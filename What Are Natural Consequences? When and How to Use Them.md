- Natural consequences help kidsÂ [learn to make good choices](https://www.verywellfamily.com/list-of-consequences-for-bad-behavior-3867837). For instance, if a child is told to put away their sidewalk chalk but leaves it outside during a rainstorm, a natural consequence would be that it gets all wet (or it might get stolen). If a child is reminded to bring a sweater to school but doesn't, they might be chilly in their cold classrooms.

- As a parent, it's tempting to just put away your child's chalk for them or rush in with the sweater. But if you do so, your child won't learn the powerful lessons that natural consequences can teach.

- The great thing about instilling natural consequences is you don't have to do much to let them work their magic. Instead, you basically just have to get out of the way and let your child experience the ramifications of their misstepsâ€”as long as it's safe to do so.

- While it's hard to let your child feel these things, the point is for them to learn from these experiences.

- **What Are Natural Consequences?**

- Essentially, natural consequences are simply what happens as a result of a person's actions, without any intervention by an outside party.

- In fact, the key to using natural consequences with kids is for the parent to step aside and allow their child to experience the effect of their what they've done or not done, saysÂ [Aliza Pressman](https://profiles.mountsinai.org/aliza-w-pressman), PhD, an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics and psychologist at Mount Sinai Kravis Childrenâ€™s Hospital in New York City.

- By not intervening when a child makes a misstep, the parent lets the child learn by doing, truly experiencing the fruits of their labors, explains Dr. Pressman.

- "Natural consequencesÂ are things that happen automatically as a result of a childâ€™s action or inaction without any purposeful behavior on the adultâ€™s part," says Dr. Fulton.

- "If the natural consequence is unwanted or unpleasant, the child has the opportunity to learn from the experience and do things differently the next time to avoid the unpleasant experience."

- **Benefits of Natural Consequences**

- **Fosters Intrinsic Motivation**

- When parents routinely rush in to do things for their kids and/or "rescue" them from their actions (or inaction), they are robbed of developing motivation to take care of their own needs.

- **Teaches Cause and Effect**

- When you use natural consequences, the goal is not simply the discomfort the child may experience, but rather that they develop an understanding of cause and effect, can make predictions, and are able to understand their own ability to impact their environment, says Dr. Fulton.

- If you spare kids from experiencing natural consequences, as parents may feel compelled to do at times, they are robbed of making the connection between their actions and what happens due to their actions.
