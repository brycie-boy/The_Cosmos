### Annotations

- The difference is that boundaries and discipline are about **teaching**, whereas punishment is about retribution

- Punishment often includes shaming and blaming which can really harm our children’s self-worth. Causing children to feel shame about their behaviour without giving them the skills or tools to do better will likely lead to worsening behaviour. “Shame is the most disabling learning disability.” — Hallowell & Ratey

- it’s not Johnny’s fault that the adults in his life haven’t taken the time to look beneath the surface to discover the underlying causes of his behaviour. 

- if we are repeating **_our_** behaviour of punishing him in this way, despite the fact that it’s not **_helping_** **him**, then why aren’t **_we_** learning and changing **_our_** behaviour?

- In 2018, [Ford and colleagues found](https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329171700215X) that excluding or suspending children from school [raises their risk](https://chadd.org/adhd-weekly/school-suspension-risk-higher-for-students-with-adhd/) of long-term mental health concerns and distress.

- Additionally, more [recent research has demonstrated](https://doi.org/10.1177/0044118X19896716) that suspensions are associated with increased misbehaviour and additional sanctioning, so they actually make problems worse both for the child and for the school.

- if no interventions are put in place to actually support the child, then they still have no idea how to do better, and the cycle continues. We’re essentially shaming and punishing children for not having skills when we haven’t taken the time to **_teach_** them.

- Not to mention the fact that what we’re role-modelling is [punishment and retribution](https://medium.com/neurodiversified/retribution-versus-restoration-58e456d351b0), which is often what we’re punishing the child for in the first place…. When you think about it that way, doesn’t it sound hypocritical and even cruel?

- If a child’s behaviour is disruptive, harmful, or maladaptive, how do we help them? Look for the root cause, the underlying factors that are driving the behaviour. [All behaviour is communication](https://medium.com/neurodiversified/the-adhd-iceberg-explained-b6b61474c768). What is the child trying to tell us? Believe it or not, it is extremely rare for a child to misbehave just for the sake of it.

- How do we find this out? Here’s a novel idea, why don’t we ask the child? When I say ask, I don’t mean interrogate, I mean **ask** with the intent of truly understanding their experience and perspective. Ask open-ended questions without blame or shame, and truly listen to the answers. Observe the child, build and strengthen your relationship with the child, and **talk** to the child

- If you take the time to do a little detective work with a focus on understanding, compassion, and empathy you’ll be surprised what you can learn.

- Give children the dignity of being treated like the competent human beings that they are, they are people who have something very important to contribute to the problem-solving process.

- If we ask children and they say “_I don’t know_”, don’t push, and don’t guilt them for not having an answer. It may very likely be the truth, and this can be a further source of anxiety for them.

- Punishing them for behaviour they cannot control, or making them feel shame when they can’t explain themselves, will only add to their [stress](https://medium.com/neurodiversified/misbehaviour-is-stress-behaviour-f077cee16f43). When children feel [stress](https://medium.com/neurodiversified/misbehaviour-is-stress-behaviour-f077cee16f43), there is a subconscious [perception of threat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43736726-beyond-behaviors) that underlies their behaviours, which are **adaptive** and emerge from an instinctive drive toward self-protection.

- Instead, offer your observations or insights in a non-judgemental, non-leading way, and invite the child to be part of the problem-solving process.
