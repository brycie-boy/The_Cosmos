## The four nobel truths  #üß†  

Sentient beings wander and roam in [[Samsara]] becuase they have not understood and penetrated the four nobel truths. As the chain of [[Dependant Origination]] shows, what lies at the base of the causal genesis of dissatisfaction is ignorance, and ignorance is unawareness of the four nobel truths. Thus those who fail to understand the four nobel truths generate [[Volitional formations]] and fall down the precipice of birth, aging, and death. The antidote of ignorance is knowledge. which is accordingly defined as the knowledge of the four nobel truths. The first penetration of the four nobel truths occurs with the attainment of [[Stream-entry]], called the breakthrough to the [[Dhamma]]. Once the disiple makes a breakthrough and sees the four nobel truths, more work still lies ahead, for each truth imposes a task that must be fulfilled in order win the final fruit. 

- The truth of dissatisfaction, which consists of [[The five aggregates]], must be fully understood. 
- The truth of its origin, craving, must be abandoned. 
- The truth of cessation, [[Nibbana]], must be realized. 
- The truth of the way leading to cessation, [[The Nobel Eightfold Path]], must be developed. 

The development of [[The Nobel Eightfold Path]] brings to completion all four tasks, at which point one reaches the distruction of [[The taints]]. This process begins with the penetration of the same four nobel truths, and thus [[The Nikayas]] say that the distruction of the taints is for those who know and see the four nobel truths.
