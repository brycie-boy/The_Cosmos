## The four nobel truths  # 

Sentient beings wander and roam in [[Samsara]] becuase they have not understood and penetrated the four nobel truths. As the chain of [[Dependant Origination]] shows, what lies at the base of the causal genesis of dissatisfaction is ignorance, and ignorance is unawareness of the four nobel truths. Thus those who fail to understand the four nobel truths generate volitional formations and fall down the precipice of birth, aging, and death. The antidote of ignorance is knowledge. which is accordingly defined as the knowledge of the four nobel truths. The first penetration of the four nobel truths occurs with the attainment of [[Stream-entry]], called the breakthrough to the [[Dhamma]]. Once the diciple makes a breakthrough and sees the four nobel truths, more work still lies ahead, for each truth imposes a task that must be fulfilled inorder win the final fruit.
