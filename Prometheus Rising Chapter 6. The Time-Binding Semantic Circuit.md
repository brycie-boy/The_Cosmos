The third semantic circuit handles artifacts and makes a ‚Äúmap‚Äù (reality-tunnel) which can be passed on to others, even across generations. These ‚Äúmaps‚Äù may be paintings, blueprints, words, concepts, tools (with instructions on use transmitted verbally), theories, music, etc.

Human beings (domesticated primates) are symbol-using creatures; which means, as the pioneer semanticist, Korzybski, noted, that those who rule symbols, rule us.

If Moses, Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, Jesus and St. Paul can be considered living influences‚Äîand they are: look around the world‚Äîthis is only because their Signal has been carried to us by human symbol systems.

These systems include words, artworks, music, rituals and unrecognized rituals (‚Äúgames‚Äù) through which culture is transmitted.

The semantic circuit allows us to sub-divide things, and reconnect things, at pleasure. There is no end to its busy-busy-busy labeling and packaging of experience. On the personal level, this is the ‚Äúinternal monologue‚Äù discovered by Joyce in Ulysses. On the historical level, this is the time-binding function described by Korzybski, which allows each generation to add new categories to our mental library‚Äîconnecting new things, separating new things, reclassifying and reshuffling forever.

In ordinary language, the semantic circuit is usually called ‚Äúthe mind.‚Äù (As psychologist Robert Ornstein said in a recent radio show, when we say someone ‚Äúhas a good mind,‚Äù we generally mean they have a good mouth, i.e., they use the semantic circuit well.)

In terms of Transactional Analysis, the first (oral) circuit is called the Natural Child, the second (emotional) circuit is called the Adapted Child, and the semantic circuit is called the Adult or Computer. In Jungian terms, the first circuit mediates sensation, the second circuit feeling, and the third circuit reason.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 1050
The neurological components of the first circuit go back to the oldest parts of the brain; Carl Sagan called these functions ‚Äúthe reptile brain.‚Äù These neural structures are at least billions of years old. The second circuit structures appeared with the first amphibians and mammals, somewhere around 1000 million or 500 million years ago; Sagan called them ‚Äúthe mammalian brain.‚Äù The semantic circuit appeared perhaps 100 thousand years ago; Sagan called it ‚Äúthe human brain.‚Äù

In this time-binding dimension, Einstein replaced Newton before most of the world* had heard of Newton; simple arithmetic gave birth to algebra, which brought forth calculus, which produced tensor calculus, etc. Haydn and Mozart prepared the way for Beethoven, who broke into the realms that the Romantics and Wagnerians took over, which gave birth to what is called music today. ~‚Ä¢~ * Most of the world was illiterate until the 1970s. ~‚Ä¢~

So-called ‚Äúfuture shock‚Äù has always been with us, since the semantic circuit began functioning somewhere in pre-history. In a symbolizing, calculating, abstracting species, all times are ‚Äútimes of change.‚Äù The process is however accelerating faster as time passes, because the symbolizing faculty is inherently self-augmenting.

Since words contain both denotations (referents in the sensory-existential world) and connotations (emotional tones and poetic or rhetorical hooks), humans can be moved to action even by words which have no real meaning or reference in actuality. This is the mechanism of demagoguery, advertising and much of organized religion.

It should be no surprise that most people, most of the time, are controlled more by the older reptilian-mammalian circuits than by the human semantic (rational) circuit, or that the semantic circuit is so easily perverted into false logics (bigotries, intolerant ideologies, fanaticisms of all sorts) when the bio-survival circuit signals threat to life or the emotional circuit flashes threat to status. Cynics, satirists and ‚Äúmystics‚Äù (circuit V-VIII types) have told us over and over that ‚Äúreason is a whore,‚Äù i.e., that the semantic circuit is notoriously vulnerable to manipulation by the older, more primitive circuits. However much the Rationalist may resent this, it is always true in the short run‚Äîthat is, to use one of the Rationalist‚Äôs favorite words, it is always pragmatically true. Whoever can scare people enough (produce bio-survival anxiety) can sell them quickly on any verbal map that seems to give them relief, i.e., cure the anxiety. By frightening people with Hell and then offering them Salvation, the most ignorant or crooked individuals can ‚Äúsell‚Äù a whole system of thought that cannot bear two minutes of rational analysis.

The emotional-territorial or ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù circuit also contains the pack‚Äôs status programs or pecking order. Working in tandem with first-circuit bio-survival anxieties, it is always able to pervert the functioning of the semantic-rational circuit. Whatever threatens loss of status, and whatever invades one‚Äôs ‚Äúspace‚Äù (including one‚Äôs ideological ‚Äúhead space‚Äù), is a threat to the average domesticated primate. Thus, if a poor man has one status prop in his life‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm a white man, not a goddam nigger‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm normal, not a goddam faggot‚Äù or whatever‚Äîany attempt to preach* tolerance, common humanity, relativism, etc. is not processed through the semantic circuit but through the emotional circuit, and is rejected as an attack on status (ego, social role).

*Of course, preaching itself is bad second circuit politics, since it puts you one-up on the person preached-at. You are not one-up unless imprinted as such by being an alpha male in the same gene-pool or conditioned as such by being a ‚Äúboss‚Äù or other authority-figure. The counter-culture of the 1960‚Äôs, like may other idealistic movements, failed because it did so much preaching from a morally one-up position when nobody had been imprinted or conditioned to accept it as one-up.

The attentive reader will remember that the grid of the first two circuits puts the pre-verbal child in a two-dimensional world,

The third, semantic circuit seems intimately connected with three dimensionality (although our binocular vision, of course, also plays a role here). Specifically, right-handedness is a human, or at least a primate, trait. Other mammals show no right-hand preference; they are ambidextrous.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 1082
Recent neurology has shown that our right-handedness is intimately connected with our tendency to use the left hemisphere of the brain more than the right.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 1085
Thus, there is a genetic (hard-wired) preference, in most humans, for right-handed manipulations and left-brain mentations. Now these connections seem intimately involved with our verbal, semantic circuitry, because the left brain is the ‚Äútalking‚Äù brain. It is linear, analytical, computer-like and very verbal. Thus, there is a neurological basis for the linkage between mapping and manipulating. The right hand manipulates the universe (and makes artifacts) and the left-brain maps the results into a model, which allows for predictions about future behavior of that part of the universe. These are the distinctly human (postprimate) characteristics.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 1089
The left-handed, on the contrary, specialize in right-brain functions, which are holistic, supra-verbal, ‚Äúintuitive,‚Äù musical and ‚Äúmystical.‚Äù Leonardo, Beethoven and Nietzsche, for instance, were all left-handed. Traditionally, left-handed people have been the subject of both dread and awe‚Äîregarded as weird, shamanic, and probably in special communication with ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Devil.‚Äù*

- Highlight(pink) - Location 1095
Aleister Crowley knew about this pragmatically, before modern neurology. He taught his pupils to learn to write equally well with both hands, thereby forcing the dormant right brain to spring to activity.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 1098
There is thus a cross-over which makes for a left-right polarity in both brain-functioning and hand-functioning, each being a reverse mirror image of the other:

This double (and reversed) right-left polarity places us neurologically in three-dimensional space. Rearranging our diagram and adding the third circuit, we can illustrate the mind-field as follows:

This is ‚ÄúEuclidean‚Äù space. It is obvious, in this context, why Euclidean space was the first kind of space discovered by mathematicians, and by artists, and why it still seems ‚Äúnatural‚Äù to us; why some have great difficulty in imagining the non-Euclidean kinds of space used in modern physics.
