The third semantic circuit handles artifacts and makes a ‚Äúmap‚Äù (reality-tunnel) which can be passed on to others, even across generations. These ‚Äúmaps‚Äù may be paintings, blueprints, words, concepts, tools (with instructions on use transmitted verbally), theories, music, etc.

Human beings (domesticated primates) are symbol-using creatures; which means, as the pioneer semanticist, Korzybski, noted, that those who rule symbols, rule us.

If Moses, Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, Jesus and St. Paul can be considered living influences‚Äîand they are: look around the world‚Äîthis is only because their Signal has been carried to us by human symbol systems.

These systems include words, artworks, music, rituals and unrecognized rituals (‚Äúgames‚Äù) through which culture is transmitted.

The semantic circuit allows us to sub-divide things, and reconnect things, at pleasure. There is no end to its busy-busy-busy labeling and packaging of experience. On the personal level, this is the ‚Äúinternal monologue‚Äù discovered by Joyce in Ulysses. On the historical level, this is the time-binding function described by Korzybski, which allows each generation to add new categories to our mental library‚Äîconnecting new things, separating new things, reclassifying and reshuffling forever.

In this time-binding dimension, Einstein replaced Newton before most of the world* had heard of Newton; simple arithmetic gave birth to algebra, which brought forth calculus, which produced tensor calculus, etc. Haydn and Mozart prepared the way for Beethoven, who broke into the realms that the Romantics and Wagnerians took over, which gave birth to what is called music today. ~‚Ä¢~ * Most of the world was illiterate until the 1970s. ~‚Ä¢~

Since words contain both denotations (referents in the sensory-existential world) and connotations (emotional tones and poetic or rhetorical hooks), humans can be moved to action even by words which have no real meaning or reference in actuality. This is the mechanism of demagoguery, advertising and much of organized religion.
