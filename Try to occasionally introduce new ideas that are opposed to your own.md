## Try to occasionally introduce new ideas that are opposed to your own  # 

Due to the fact that [[Human beings have a tendency to treat their ideologies and belief systems as territory or property]], some information is not only ignored but is actively resisted. Denial, anger, and even a desire to punish the messenger who brings "bad news" are well known traits of our species. To the extent that we are aware of this tendency, and try to combat it in our selves, we will make an effort to try to introduce unwelcomed signals‚Äîfor example, by reading periodicals of the groups who's [[Reality tunnel]]s oppose our own. To the extent that we ignore or forget this tendency within ourselves, we will relapse back into [[Fundamentalism]], [[idolatry]], and inquisitorial behavior.
