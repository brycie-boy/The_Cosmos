We will, throughout this book, consider the human brain a kind of bio-computer‚Äîan electro-colloidal computer, as distinct from the electronic or solid-state computers which exist outside our heads.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 350
Please note carefully and long remember that we have not said that the human brain is a computer. The Aristotelian idea that to understand something you must know what it _is_ has been abandoned in one science after another, for the pragmatic reason that the simple word ‚Äúis‚Äù introduces so many metaphysical assumptions that we can argue forever about them. In the most advanced sciences, such as mathematical physics, nobody talks about what anything is anymore. They talk about what model (or map) can best be used to understand whatever we are investigating.

The brain appears to be made up of matter in electro-colloidal suspension (protoplasm). Colloids are pulled together, toward a condition of gel, by their surface tensions. This is because surface tensions pull all glue-like substances together. Colloids are also, conversely, pushed apart, toward a condition of sol, by their electrical charges. This is because their electrical charges are similar, and similar electrical charges always repel each other. In the equilibrium between gel and sol, the colloidal suspension maintains its continuity and life continues. Move the suspension too far toward gel, or too far toward sol, and life ends.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 364
Any chemical that gets into the brain, changes the gel-sol balance, and ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù is accordingly influenced. Thus, potatoes are, like LSD, ‚Äúpsychedelic‚Äù‚Äîin a milder way. The changes in consciousness when one moves from a vegetarian diet to an omnivorous diet, or vice versa, are also ‚Äúpsychedelic.‚Äù Since ‚ÄúWhat the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves,‚Äù all of our ideas are psychedelic. Even without experimenting with diet or drugs, whatever you think you should see, you will see‚Äîunless it is physically impossible in this universe.

All experience is a muddle, until we make a model to explain it. The model can clarify the muddles, but the model is never the muddle itself. ‚ÄúThe map is not the territory‚Äù; the menu does not taste like the meal.

Every computer consists of two aspects, known as hardware and software. (Software here includes information).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 373
The hardware in a solid-state computer is concrete and localized, consisting of central processing unit, display, keyboard, external disk drive, CD-ROM, floppies, etc.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 375
The software consists of programs that can exist in many forms, including the totally abstract. A program can be ‚Äúin‚Äù the computer in the sense that it is recorded in the CPU or on a disk which is hitched up to the computer. A program can also exist on a piece of paper, if I invented it myself, or in a manual, if it is a standard program; in these cases, it is not ‚Äúin‚Äù the computer but can be put ‚Äúin‚Äù at any time. But a program can be even more tenuous than that; it can exist only in my head, if I have never written it down, or if I have used it once and erased it.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 379
The hardware is more ‚Äúreal‚Äù than the software in that you can always locate it in space-time

- Highlight(pink) - Location 380
On the other hand, the software is more ‚Äúreal‚Äù in the sense that you can smash the hardware back to dust (‚Äúkill‚Äù the computer) and the software still exists, and can ‚Äúmaterialize‚Äù or ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù again in a different computer. (Any speculations about reincarnation at this point are the responsibility of the reader, not of the author.)

In speaking of the human brain as an electro-colloidal biocomputer, we all know where the hardware is: it is inside the human skull. The software, however, seems to be anywhere and everywhere. For instance, the software ‚Äúin‚Äù my brain also exists outside my brain in such forms as, say, a book I read twenty years ago ... and anybody and (to some extent) any-thing that has ever impacted upon my brain. This may sound strange, but that‚Äôs the way software (or information) functions.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 389
Of course, if consciousness consisted of nothing but this undifferentiated tapioca of timeless, spaceless software, we would have no individuality, no center, no Self. We want to know, then, how out of this universal software ocean a specific person emerges. What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves.

Because the human brain, like other animal brains, acts as an electro-colloidal computer, not a solid-state computer, it follows the same laws as other animal brains. That is, the programs get into the brain, as electro-chemical bonds, in discrete quantum stages. Each set of programs consists of four basic parts: 1. Genetic Imperatives. Totally hard-wired programs or ‚Äúinstincts.‚Äù 2. Imprints. These are more-or-less hard wired programs which the brain is genetically designed to accept only at certain points in its development. These points are known, in ethology, as times of imprint vulnerability. 3. Conditioning. These are programs built onto the imprints. They are looser and fairly easy to change with counter-conditioning. 4. Learning. This is even looser and ‚Äúsofter‚Äù than conditioning.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 399
In general, the primordial imprint can always over-rule any subsequent conditioning or learning. An imprint is a species of software that has become built-in hardware, being impressed on the tender neurons when they are peculiarly open and vulnerable. Imprints (software frozen into hardware) are the non-negotiable aspects of our individuality. Out of the infinity of possible programs existing as potential software, the imprint establishes the limits, parameters, perimeters within which all subsequent conditioning and learning occurs.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 406
Before the first imprint, the consciousness of the infant is ‚Äúformless and void‚Äù‚Äîlike the universe at the beginning of Genesis, or the descriptions of unconditioned (‚Äúenlightened‚Äù i.e., exploded) consciousness in the mystic traditions. As soon as the first imprint is made, structure emerges out of the creative void. The growing mind, alas, becomes trapped within this structure. It identifies with the structure; in a sense, it becomes the structure.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 413 
Each successive imprint complicates the software which programs our experience and which we experience as "reality. ‚Äù

- Highlight(pink) - Location 414
Conditioning and learning build further networks onto this bedrock of imprinted software. The total structure of this brain-circuitry makes up our map of the world. It is what our Thinker thinks, and our Prover mechanically fits all incoming signals to the limitations of this map.
