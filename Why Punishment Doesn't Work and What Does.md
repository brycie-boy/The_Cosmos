### Annotations

- the focus of behaviour change in the past, has been on rewards and punishments. Our whole society is built on this way of thinking

- Punishment and discipline have too often been used as interchangeable terms but really they are polar opposites.

- punishment is causing deliberate harm as a retribution. Or in other words, making something bad happen to someone as a way to make them "pay" for what they did.

- Discipline is teaching and directing your child to understand and take responsibility for their actions.

- There has been so much research to prove that punishment isn't effective in the long-term (Markhams 2014, Psychology Today). Of all the studies there are key reasons why punishment just doesn't seem to bring long-term change.

- When we punish a child, they focus on what is happening to them rather than what they did that was wrong in the first place. They become more selfish and don't develop empathy for others.

- Punishment actually encourages children to lie and avoid punishment rather than avoiding the behaviour you are trying to stop

- You tend to need to keep increasing the punishments to make them work. Often parents have a list of punishments that they will try to use to control their child's behaviour. Usually, what worked for a while will stop working and you need to keep increasing the threats

- Punishment makes the child feel bad about themselves not what they did. If a child sees themselves as a "bad" person, it makes sense that they will do "bad" things

- Children don't learn to take responsibility for their own behaviour. They tend to see their behaviour being driven by someone else. They will tend to blame others for what they did and see that they need a parents to control the behaviour

- Punishment doesn't address what was behind the behaviour in the first place. It doesn't help the child learn to express their emotions, it squashes their needs and sends the message that their feelings aren't important.

- Make your expectations clear when talking to your child and explain why. A child is more likely to follow a rule if they understand why we have that rule in the first place

- Allow logical consequences Where you can let your child feel the consequence of their behaviour. 

- By doing this the child is learning to take responsibility for what happened and learning how they can restore whatever the damage was. Having logical consequences links the child's behaviour to the rule that was broken in a meaningful way.

- One of the most effective influence that we have on our child is your relationship with them.

- When we are disciplining our child, we are sitting with them, explaining what the rules were that were broken, what the consequence is and problem solving with them how they can fix it. By doing this we are working together as a team not an "us and them" type mentality. We show understanding for how they felt and we also talk about how we or others in the situation felt. By acknowledging theirs and our feelings we will connect with them and build understanding.
