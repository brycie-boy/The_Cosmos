## Mindfulness of breathing  #🧠 

Mindfulness of breathing is a meditaition subject of the [[Contemplation of body]]. It is explained per [[the Buddha]] as follows:

> ... mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short' ... he trains thus: ‘I will breathe in experiencing the whole body’; he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ ... he trains thus: ‘I will breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I will breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation.’ ... 

[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] illumunates on the passage with some notes stating:

> ...  “experiencing the whole body” [means] that the meditator becomes aware of each in-breath and out-breath through its three phases of beginning, middle, and end ... The “bodily formation” is defined as in-and-out breathing ... Thus, ... with the successful development of this practice, the meditator’s breathing becomes increasingly more quiet, tranquil, and peaceful.
