## Attention to the great elements  #🧠 

Attention to [[The great elements]], a meditation subject of the [[Contemplation of body]], is expllained below per the Buddha:

> a monk reviews this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’ ... Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces; so too, a monk reviews this same body
