## Fundamentalism  # 

Fundementalism indicates an unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs. It involves a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup distinctions, leading to an emphasis on purity and the desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established "fundamentals" and their accepted interpretation within the group often results from this tendency. Fundamentalism, as [[Robert Anton Wilson]] calls it, is when [[idolatry]] appears as an active social ideology.
