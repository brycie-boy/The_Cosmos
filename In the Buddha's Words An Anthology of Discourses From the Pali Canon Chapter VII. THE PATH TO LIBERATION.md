In this chapter, we come to the unique distinguishing feature of the Buddha’s teaching, its “supramundane” or “world-transcending” (lokuttara) path to liberation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3882
It aims to lead the practitioner to the state of liberation that lies beyond all realms of conditioned existence, to the same sorrowless and stainless bliss of Nibbāna that the Buddha himself attained on the night of his enlightenment.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3887
The Shorter Discourse to Māluṅkyāputta (MN 63), shows that the Buddhist path is not designed to provide theoretical answers to philosophical questions.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3891
Two collections of suttas in the Saṃyutta Nikāya—SN 33:1–10 and SN 44:7–8—make it clear that the Buddha’s “silence” had a deeper basis than mere pragmatic concerns.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3892
These suttas show that all such questions are based on an underlying assumption that existence is to be interpreted in terms of a self and a world in which the self is situated. Since these premises are invalid, no answer framed in terms of these premises can be valid, and thus the Buddha must reject the very questions themselves.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3895
However, while the Buddha had philosophical grounds for refusing to answer these questions, he also rejected them because he considered the obsession with their solutions to be irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3909
the purpose of practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha is “the fading away of lust, … final Nibbāna without clinging,” the Noble Eightfold Path being the way to attain each of these aims.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3911
The Noble Eightfold Path is the classical formulation of the way to liberation, as is already clear from the Buddha’s first sermon, in which he calls the Eightfold Path the way to the cessation of suffering.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3923
The eight factors are commonly distributed into three groups as follows:

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3924
1. the moral discipline group (sīlakkhandha), made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood;

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3926
2. the concentration group (sam̄dhikkhandha), made up of right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3927
3. the wisdom group (paññākkhandha), made up of right view and right intention.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3929
It might be said that the two wisdom factors are placed at the beginning because a preliminary right view and right intention are required at the outset of the path, right view providing the conceptual understanding of Buddhist principles that guides the development of the other path factors, right intention the proper motivation and direction for the development of the path.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3920
Contrary to a common assumption, the eight path factors are not steps to be followed in sequence, one after another. They are more appropriately described as components than as steps. Optimally, all eight factors should be present simultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution, like eight interwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3922
However, until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors of the path exhibit some degree of sequence in their development.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3932
In the Nikāyas, the Buddha often expounds the practice of the path as a gradual training (anupubbasikkhā) that unfolds in stages from the first step to the final goal. This gradual training is a finer subdivision of the threefold division of the path into moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3934
Invariably in the suttas the exposition of the gradual training begins with the going forth into homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of the monastic life in the Buddha’s pragmatic vision.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3936
In principle the entire practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from any mode of life, monastic or lay, and the Buddha confirms that many among his lay followers were accomplished in the Dhamma and had attained the first three of the four stages of awakening, up to nonreturning

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3938
(an̄ḡm̄; Theravāda commentators say that lay followers can also attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but they do so either on the verge of death or after attainment immediately seek the going forth).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3939
The fact remains, however, that the household life inevitably fosters a multitude of mundane concerns and personal attachments that impede the single-hearted quest for liberation. Thus when the Buddha set out on his own noble quest he did so by going into homelessness,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3941
after his enlightenment, as a practical way to help others, he established the Saṅgha, the order of monks and nuns, for those who want to devote themselves fully to the Dhamma unhindered by the cares of household life.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3943
The gradual training occurs in two versions: a longer version in the Dīgha Nikāya and a middle-length version in the Majjhima Nikāya.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3944
(1) the longer version has a more detailed treatment of the observances that pertain to monastic etiquette and ascetic self-restraint;

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3945
(2) the longer version includes eight types of higher knowledge while the middle-length version has three types. However, as these three types are the ones mentioned in the Buddha’s account of his own enlightenment (see Text II,3(2)), they are by far the most important.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3951
The sequence opens with the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world and his exposition of the Dhamma. Having heard this, the disciple acquires faith and follows the Teacher into homelessness. He then undertakes the rules of discipline that promote the purification of conduct and the right livelihood of an ascetic.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3953
The next three steps—contentment, restraint of the sense faculties, and mindfulness and clear comprehension—internalize the process of purification and thereby bridge the transition from moral discipline to concentration.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3954
The section on the abandonment of the five hindrances deals with the preliminary training in concentration. The five hindrances—sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt—are the principal obstacles to meditative development, and thus they must be removed for the mind to become collected and unified.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3961
The Buddha enumerates four jhānas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each more refined and elevated than its predecessor.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3963
Although wisdom rather than concentration is the critical factor in the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddha invariably includes the jhānas in the gradual training for at least two reasons: first, because they contribute to the intrinsic perfection of the path; and second, because the deep concentration they induce serves as a basis for the arising of insight.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3965
The Buddha calls the jhānas the “footsteps of the Tathāgata” (MN 27.19–22) and shows them to be precursors of the bliss of Nibbāna that lies at the end of the training.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3967
From the fourth jhāna three alternative lines of further development become possible.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3968
four meditative states that continue the mental unification established by the jhānas. These states, described as “the liberations that are peaceful and formless,” are further refinements of concentration.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3969
Distinguished from the jhānas by their transcendence of the subtle mental image that serves as the object in the jhānas, they are named the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.

= Highlight(pink) - Location 3972
A second line of development is the acquisition of supernormal knowledge.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3972
The Buddha frequently refers to a set of six types,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3973
six kinds of direct knowledge

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3973
The last of these, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, is “supramundane” or world-transcending and thus marks the culmination of the third line of development. But the other five are all mundane, products of the extraordinarily powerful mental concentration achieved in the fourth jhāna:

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3975
the supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3977
The jhānas and the formless attainments by themselves do not issue in enlightenment and liberation. Though lofty and peaceful, they can only silence the defilements that sustain the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3978
To uproot the defilements at the most fundamental level, and thereby arrive at enlightenment and liberation, the meditative process must be directed to a third line of development. This is the contemplation of “things as they really are,” which results in increasingly deeper insights into the nature of existence and culminates in the final goal, the attainment of arahantship.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3981
This line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the passage on the gradual training.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3982
he prefaces it with descriptions of two of the direct knowledges,

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3982
the recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3983
collectively called the three true knowledges

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3984
Although the first two are not essential to the realization of arahantship, the Buddha probably includes them here because they reveal the truly vast and profound dimensions of suffering in saṃsāra, thereby preparing the mind for the penetration of the Four Noble Truths by which that suffering is diagnosed and surmounted.

- Highlight(pink) - 3986
The passage on the gradual training does not explicitly show the process of contemplation by which the meditator develops insight. The whole process is only implied by the mention of its final fruit, called the knowledge of the destruction of the taints

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3915
While we are often told that the practice of the Buddhist path depends entirely on personal effort, this sutta emphasizes the importance of spiritual friendship.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3917
the endeavor to attain spiritual perfection is not a purely solitary enterprise but occurs in dependence on close personal ties.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3918
Spiritual friendship gives the practice of the Dhamma an inescapably human dimension and welds the body of Buddhist practitioners into a community united both vertically by the relationship of teacher to students and horizontally by friendships among peers treading a shared path.
