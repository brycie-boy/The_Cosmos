In this chapter, we come to the unique distinguishing feature of the Buddha‚Äôs teaching, its ‚Äúsupramundane‚Äù or ‚Äúworld-transcending‚Äù (lokuttara) path to liberation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3882
It aims to lead the practitioner to the state of liberation that lies beyond all realms of conditioned existence, to the same sorrowless and stainless bliss of NibbƒÅna that the Buddha himself attained on the night of his enlightenment.

The Shorter Discourse to MƒÅlu·πÖkyƒÅputta (MN 63), shows that the Buddhist path is not designed to provide theoretical answers to philosophical questions.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3891
Two collections of suttas in the Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya‚ÄîSN 33:1‚Äì10 and SN 44:7‚Äì8‚Äîmake it clear that the Buddha‚Äôs ‚Äúsilence‚Äù had a deeper basis than mere pragmatic concerns.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3892
These suttas show that all such questions are based on an underlying assumption that existence is to be interpreted in terms of a self and a world in which the self is situated. Since these premises are invalid, no answer framed in terms of these premises can be valid, and thus the Buddha must reject the very questions themselves.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3895
However, while the Buddha had philosophical grounds for refusing to answer these questions, he also rejected them because he considered the obsession with their solutions to be irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering.

the purpose of practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha is ‚Äúthe fading away of lust, ‚Ä¶ final NibbƒÅna without clinging,‚Äù the Noble Eightfold Path being the way to attain each of these aims.

The Noble Eightfold Path is the classical formulation of the way to liberation,

The eight factors are commonly distributed into three groups as follows:

1. the moral discipline group (sƒ´lakkhandha), made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood;

2. the concentration group (samÃÑdhikkhandha), made up of right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;

3. the wisdom group (pa√±√±ƒÅkkhandha), made up of right view and right intention.

Contrary to a common assumption, the eight path factors are not steps to be followed in sequence, one after another. They are more appropriately described as components than as steps. Optimally, all eight factors should be present simultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution, like eight interwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3922
However, until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors of the path exhibit some degree of sequence in their development.

While we are often told that the practice of the Buddhist path depends entirely on personal effort, this sutta emphasizes the importance of spiritual friendship.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3917
the endeavor to attain spiritual perfection is not a purely solitary enterprise but occurs in dependence on close personal ties.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3918
Spiritual friendship gives the practice of the Dhamma an inescapably human dimension and welds the body of Buddhist practitioners into a community united both vertically by the relationship of teacher to students and horizontally by friendships among peers treading a shared path.
