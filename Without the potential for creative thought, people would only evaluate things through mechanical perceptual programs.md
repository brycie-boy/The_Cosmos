## Without the potential for creative thought, people would only evaluate things through mechanical perceptual programs  # 

It appears that, over the ages, some humans have noticed how [[We have a tendency to see the world through a lens of prejudiced generalizations]] and have developed the ability to criticize and examine these neurological programs. the members of this group cannot be mechanically predicted. At times they may exibit the characteristics refered to as "growth" or "creativity." And it also appears that [[idolatry]] and [[Fundamentalism]] can be biologicaly described as normal mammalian behavior‚Äîmechanical [[imprint]]ing and [[Conditioning]] combined with the fact that [[People have a tendency to become territorial over there ideologies and belief systems]]. in that case, unless any real possibility of creative thought exists, only mechanical mammalian programs of [[Perception]] will determine how we evaluate any incident or event, from the chair across the room to tales of bleeding catholic statues or charmed quarks or UFOs. 

Artisits, as well as mytics, are always telling us how we do not look at the world closely enough. We follow conditioned programs so often that we forget to exercise our potential creativity. The artist tries to jar us out of this conditioned or hypnotic state by presenting something to us in a new way. The mystic may try to jar us by getting us to stare at a wall or an apple or someother thing until‚Äîthrough the stress of social and sensory deprivation‚Äîwe stop "seeing" the what we have always saw and start "seeing" in a new way. [[Robert Anton Wilson]] uses neither the artist or the mystic method but instead tries to look at the things which we ordinarily ignore and dismiss without placing one of our habitual [[idol]]s in the way of our vision.
