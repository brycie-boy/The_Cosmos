“And the earth was void without form”

Nebulas are what i call my inbox notes.

Nebulas have 2 stages:

- **💥 Supernova**
	
     This is what i call my unprocessed inbox notes. All the annotations i collect during [[Ingestion]] are copied and pasted onto an inbox scrap. At this stage, the annotations are of little informational value, they are atomized, scattered, and unrelated. This is fine. Think of it as a reminder saying "hey, look at this passage".
	
     When processing these annotations you'll want to be able to see the big picture and see clusters of ideas. I cluster annotations within an actual inbox note that I open along side the scrap. Annations can be clustered in what ever way makes sense to you ([[Do your own thinking]]). These clusters are then written as [[⛅️ Proto Notes]]

- **☁️ Nebula**
	
	When the chaos of the supernova subsides, and gravity has condensed all the annotations into fully formed stars, then the inbox note process is complete. The inbox note then recieves certified nebula status. Before i do this, i double check all of my [[⛅️ Proto Notes]] along side their relative inbox notes to see if i want to add any futher details. It isnt until after this that the nebula is marked as complete.
