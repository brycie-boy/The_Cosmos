What many people seem to claim is that adhd symptoms are fixed, that you are stuck like that, and that the only way to deal with it is through stimulant medications

In all honestly I think this is just an excuse to sell stimulants

Dopamine is released when we anticipate reward. The anticipation of reward allows us to concentrate

Stimulants give you a false sense of fullfilment

Well according to Buddhist samadhi meditation, Buddhist literature non chalantly seems to propose that concentration is something that you can improve. Buddhist samadhi

I personally believe adhd is an emotional issue

The reason we can’t concentrate is because we are either longing for one thing or are dejected by another and therefore the present moment is not on our mind. Getting over this takes a degree of detachment which culminates over a long time

I think people with adhd have simply developed habitual tendencies to impulsively react to there emotions

Many people, in the context of adhd, seem to completely forget about neuroplasticity and habit formation

Buddhist monks have been shows to have thicker and larger prefrontal cortex’s 

Many people with adhd are not looking for a solution

If they are, they’re looking or a quick and easy one, because people with adhd already have an underdeveloped ability to commit to difficult tasks.

I feel that the majority of mental issues are imposed into us by our environment. But it seems that all the blame is often put onto us
