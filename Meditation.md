## Meditation  #üß† 
 
The [[Uposatha Observance]] regards [[Moral Disipline]] as an observance with a training in self restraint, simplicity, and contentment, in this respect they prepare the disciple for the training of the mind undertaken in the practice of meditation. 

The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to liberation but is a also a source of merit. Meditation practices, even those that do not lead directy to insight, help purify the grosser levels of mental defilement and uncover deeper demensions of the minds purity and radiance. 

There are four meditations that produce mundane merit refered to by the Buddha as the "devine abodes" or "immesurable states", which include:

- lovng-kindness: the wish for the welfare and happiness of all beings
- compassion: a feeling of empathy for all those afflicted with suffering
- altruistic joy: The feeling of happiness for the success and good fortune of others
- equanimity: A balanced reaction to joy and misery which protects one from agitation

The most fruitful being loving-kindness. These meditations are said to bring rebirth in the brahma world. While the brahmins regarded the brahma world as the highest attainment, for the Buddha it was just one exhalted sphere of rebirth.
