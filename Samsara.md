## Samsara #🧠 

In Buddhism, Samsara is the continuous cycle of repeated birth, mundane existance, and death without a disernable begging. It is described as a mindless wandering from one life to the next with no paticular direction. This mindless wandering is perpetauted through craving and ignorance.

Rebirths occur within 6 realms of existance. These realms are subdivided into 2 categories. the good realms, and the evil realms. The good realms are composed of three planes, the heavenly plane, the demi god plane, and human plane. The evil realms are composed of three planes, the animal plane, the hungry ghost plane, and the hellish plane.
