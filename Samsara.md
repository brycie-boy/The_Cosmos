## Samsara #🧠 

In Buddhism, Samsara is the continuous cycle of repeated birth, mundane existance, and death without a disernable begging or end. It is described as a pointless wandering from one life to the next with no paticular direction. This pointless wandering is perpetauted through craving and ignorance.
