In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses From the Pali Canon

Bhikkhu Bodhi

---

INTRODUCTION

Highlight(pink) - Location 3879

In this chapter, we come to the unique distinguishing feature of the Buddha’s teaching, its “supramundane” or “world-transcending” (lokuttara) path to liberation.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3882

It aims to lead the practitioner to the state of liberation that lies beyond all realms of conditioned existence, to the same sorrowless and stainless bliss of Nibbāna that the Buddha himself attained on the night of his enlightenment.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3887

The Shorter Discourse to Māluṅkyāputta (MN 63), shows that the Buddhist path is not designed to provide theoretical answers to philosophical questions.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3891

Two collections of suttas in the Saṃyutta Nikāya—SN 33:1–10 and SN 44:7–8—make it clear that the Buddha’s “silence” had a deeper basis than mere pragmatic concerns.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3892

These suttas show that all such questions are based on an underlying assumption that existence is to be interpreted in terms of a self and a world in which the self is situated. Since these premises are invalid, no answer framed in terms of these premises can be valid, and thus the Buddha must reject the very questions themselves.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3895

However, while the Buddha had philosophical grounds for refusing to answer these questions, he also rejected them because he considered the obsession with their solutions to be irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3898

Against the picture of the saṃsāric background sketched at the end of the previous chapter, this statement now takes on an expanded meaning: the “destruction of birth, aging, and death” is not merely the end of suffering in a single lifetime, but the end of the immeasurable suffering of repeated birth, aging, and death that we have undergone in the countless eons of saṃsāra.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3905

The Buddha declares that none of these stations along the way—not moral discipline, concentration, or even knowledge and vision—is the final goal of the spiritual life. The goal, its heartwood or essential purpose, is “unshakable liberation of the mind,” and he urges those who have entered the path not to be satisfied with anything less.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3909

the purpose of practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha is “the fading away of lust, … final Nibbāna without clinging,” the Noble Eightfold Path being the way to attain each of these aims.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3911

The Noble Eightfold Path is the classical formulation of the way to liberation,

Highlight(pink) - Location 3913

The detailed application will be filled out later in this chapter and in chapters VIII and IX.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3915

While we are often told that the practice of the Buddhist path depends entirely on personal effort, this sutta emphasizes the importance of spiritual friendship.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3917

the endeavor to attain spiritual perfection is not a purely solitary enterprise but occurs in dependence on close personal ties.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3918

Spiritual friendship gives the practice of the Dhamma an inescapably human dimension and welds the body of Buddhist practitioners into a community united both vertically by the relationship of teacher to students and horizontally by friendships among peers treading a shared path.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3920

Contrary to a common assumption, the eight path factors are not steps to be followed in sequence, one after another. They are more appropriately described as components than as steps. Optimally, all eight factors should be present simultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution, like eight interwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3922

However, until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors of the path exhibit some degree of sequence in their development.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3923

The eight factors are commonly distributed into three groups as follows:

Bookmark - Location 3923

Highlight(pink) - Location 3924

1. the moral discipline group (sīlakkhandha), made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood;

Highlight(pink) - Location 3926

2. the concentration group (sam̄dhikkhandha), made up of right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;

Highlight(pink) - Location 3927

3. the wisdom group (paññākkhandha), made up of right view and right intention.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3929

It might be said that the two wisdom factors are placed at the beginning because a preliminary right view and right intention are required at the outset of the path, right view providing the conceptual understanding of Buddhist principles that guides the development of the other path factors, right intention the proper motivation and direction for the development of the path.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3932

In the Nikāyas, the Buddha often expounds the practice of the path as a gradual training (anupubbasikkhā) that unfolds in stages from the first step to the final goal. This gradual training is a finer subdivision of the threefold division of the path into moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3934

Invariably in the suttas the exposition of the gradual training begins with the going forth into homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of the monastic life in the Buddha’s pragmatic vision.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3936

In principle the entire practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from any mode of life, monastic or lay, and the Buddha confirms that many among his lay followers were accomplished in the Dhamma and had attained the first three of the four stages of awakening, up to nonreturning

Highlight(pink) - Location 3938

(an̄ḡm̄; Theravāda commentators say that lay followers can also attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but they do so either on the verge of death or after attainment immediately seek the going forth).

Highlight(pink) - Location 3939

The fact remains, however, that the household life inevitably fosters a multitude of mundane concerns and personal attachments that impede the single-hearted quest for liberation. Thus when the Buddha set out on his own noble quest he did so by going into homelessness,

Highlight(pink) - Location 3941

after his enlightenment, as a practical way to help others, he established the Saṅgha, the order of monks and nuns, for those who want to devote themselves fully to the Dhamma unhindered by the cares of household life.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3943

The gradual training occurs in two versions: a longer version in the Dīgha Nikāya and a middle-length version in the Majjhima Nikāya.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3944

(1) the longer version has a more detailed treatment of the observances that pertain to monastic etiquette and ascetic self-restraint;

Highlight(pink) - Location 3945

(2) the longer version includes eight types of higher knowledge while the middle-length version has three types. However, as these three types are the ones mentioned in the Buddha’s account of his own enlightenment (see Text II,3(2)), they are by far the most important.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3947

The main paradigm for the longer version of the gradual training is found at DN 2; the middle-length version is at MN 27 and MN 51, with variants at MN 38, MN 39, MN 53, MN 107, and MN 125.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3951

The sequence opens with the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world and his exposition of the Dhamma. Having heard this, the disciple acquires faith and follows the Teacher into homelessness. He then undertakes the rules of discipline that promote the purification of conduct and the right livelihood of an ascetic.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3953

The next three steps—contentment, restraint of the sense faculties, and mindfulness and clear comprehension—internalize the process of purification and thereby bridge the transition from moral discipline to concentration.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3954

The section on the abandonment of the five hindrances deals with the preliminary training in concentration. The five hindrances—sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt—are the principal obstacles to meditative development, and thus they must be removed for the mind to become collected and unified.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3960

The next stage in the sequence describes the attainment of the jhānas, profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully absorbed in its object.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3961

The Buddha enumerates four jhānas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each more refined and elevated than its predecessor.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3963

Although wisdom rather than concentration is the critical factor in the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddha invariably includes the jhānas in the gradual training for at least two reasons: first, because they contribute to the intrinsic perfection of the path; and second, because the deep concentration they induce serves as a basis for the arising of insight.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3965

The Buddha calls the jhānas the “footsteps of the Tathāgata” (MN 27.19–22) and shows them to be precursors of the bliss of Nibbāna that lies at the end of the training.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3967

From the fourth jhāna three alternative lines of further development become possible.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3968

four meditative states that continue the mental unification established by the jhānas. These states, described as “the liberations that are peaceful and formless,” are further refinements of concentration.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3969

Distinguished from the jhānas by their transcendence of the subtle mental image that serves as the object in the jhānas, they are named the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3972

A second line of development is the acquisition of supernormal knowledge.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3972

The Buddha frequently refers to a set of six types,

Highlight(pink) - Location 3973

six kinds of direct knowledge

Highlight(pink) - Location 3973

The last of these, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, is “supramundane” or world-transcending and thus marks the culmination of the third line of development. But the other five are all mundane, products of the extraordinarily powerful mental concentration achieved in the fourth jhāna:

Highlight(pink) - Location 3975

the supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings

Highlight(pink) - Location 3977

The jhānas and the formless attainments by themselves do not issue in enlightenment and liberation. Though lofty and peaceful, they can only silence the defilements that sustain the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3978

To uproot the defilements at the most fundamental level, and thereby arrive at enlightenment and liberation, the meditative process must be directed to a third line of development. This is the contemplation of “things as they really are,” which results in increasingly deeper insights into the nature of existence and culminates in the final goal, the attainment of arahantship.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3981

This line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the passage on the gradual training.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3982

two of the direct knowledges,

Highlight(pink) - Location 3982

the recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3983

collectively called the three true knowledges

Highlight(pink) - Location 3984

Although the first two are not essential to the realization of arahantship, the Buddha probably includes them here because they reveal the truly vast and profound dimensions of suffering in saṃsāra, thereby preparing the mind for the penetration of the Four Noble Truths by which that suffering is diagnosed and surmounted.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3988

The āsavas or taints are a classification of defilements considered in their role of sustaining the forward movement of the process of birth and death.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3989

The commentaries derive the word from a root su meaning “to flow.” Scholars differ as to whether the flow implied by the prefix ā is inward or outward; hence some have rendered it as “influxes” or “influences,” others as “outflows” or “effluents.” A stock passage in the suttas indicates the term’s real significance independently of etymology when it describes the āsavas as states “that defile, bring renewal of existence, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, aging, and death” (MN 36.47; I 250). Thus other translators, bypassing the literal meaning, have rendered it “cankers,” “corruptions,” or “taints.”

Highlight(pink) - Location 3994

The three taints mentioned in the Nikāyas are respectively synonyms for craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and ignorance.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3995

When the disciple’s mind is liberated from the taints by the completion of the path of arahantship, he reviews his newly won freedom and roars his lion’s roar: “Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming back to any state of being.”

VII. THE PATH TO LIBERATION

Highlight(pink) - Location 3999

The Arrow of Birth, Aging, and Death

Highlight(pink) - Location 4002

“These speculative views have been left undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside and rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the world is not eternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world is infinite’; ‘the soul is the same as the body’ and ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’1

Highlight(pink) - Location 4041

“Māluṅkyāputta, if there is the view ‘the world is eternal,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived;

Highlight(pink) - Location 4042

if there is the view ‘the world is not eternal, ’ the spiritual life cannot be lived.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4043

Whether there is the view ‘the world is eternal’ or the view ‘the world is not eternal,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4045

“If there is the view ‘the world is finite’ ... ‘the world is infinite’ ‘the soul is the same as the body’ ... ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived.… If there is the view ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived;

Highlight(pink) - Location 4047

if there is the view ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’

Highlight(pink) - Location 4048

the spiritual life cannot be lived.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4048

Whether there is the view ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ or the view ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist,’ there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4057

“Why have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4059

“And what have I declared? ‘This is suffering’—I have declared. ‘This is the origin of suffering’—I have declared. ‘This is the cessation of suffering’—I have declared. ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—I have declared.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4061

“Why have I declared that? Because it is beneficial, it belongs to the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4067

The Heartwood of the Spiritual Life

Highlight(pink) - Location 4142

“So this spiritual life, monks, does not have gain, honor, and renown for its benefit, or the attainment of moral discipline for its benefit, or the attainment of concentration for its benefit, or knowledge and vision for its benefit. But it is this unshakable liberation of mind that is the goal of this spiritual life, its heartwood, and its end.”6

The Fading Away of Lust

Highlight(pink) - Location 4147

“Monks, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the spiritual life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust7

Highlight(pink) - Location 4152

“And what, monks, is that path, that way for the fading away of lust? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is the path, the way for the fading away of lust.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4155

“[Or else you may answer them:] ‘It is, friends, for the abandoning of the fetters … for the uprooting of the underlying tendencies … for the full understanding of the course [of saṃsāra] … for the destruction of the taints … for the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation … for the sake of knowledge and vision … for the sake of final Nibbāna without clinging that the spiritual life is lived under the Blessed One.’

Highlight(pink) - Location 4161

“And what, monks, is that path, that way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right concentration. This is the path, the way for attaining final Nibbāna without clinging.

“And what, monks, is the Noble Eightfold Path? Right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4169

“And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering, knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is called right view.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4170

“And what, monks, is right intention? Intention of renunciation, intention of non–ill will, intention of harmlessness: this is called right intention.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4172

“And what, monks, is right speech? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence from malicious speech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from idle chatter: this is called right speech.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4173

“And what, monks, is right action? Abstinence from the destruction of life, abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from sexual misconduct: this is called right action.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4175

“And what, monks, is right livelihood? Here a noble disciple, having abandoned a wrong mode of livelihood, earns his living by a right livelihood: this is called right livelihood.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4176

“And what, monks, is right effort? Here, monks, a monk generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states…. He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states…. He generates desire for the continuation of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called right effort.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4181

“And what, monks is right mindfulness? Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body,

Highlight(pink) - Location 4182

He dwells contemplating feelings

Highlight(pink) - Location 4183

He dwells contemplating mind in mind,

Highlight(pink) - Location 4184

He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena,

“And what, monks, is right concentration?

which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.

second jhāna,

Highlight(pink) - Location 4188

which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4189

With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’

Highlight(pink) - Location 4190

With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna,

Highlight(pink) - Location 4191

which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4193

(SN 45:8; V 8–10)

“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! This is the entire spiritual life,

THE GRADUATED TRAINING

Highlight(pink) - Location 4251

the Blessed One told him: “At this point, brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint has not yet been completed in detail.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4264

“So too, brahmin, here a Tathāgata appears in the world,

He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,

Highlight(pink) - Location 4269

“A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the spiritual life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.

Highlight(pink) - Location 4274

“Having thus gone forth and possessing the monk’s training and way of life, abandoning the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life; with rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious, merciful, he dwells compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; taking only what is given, expecting only what is given, by not stealing he dwells in purity. Abandoning sexual relations, he observes celibacy, living apart, refraining from the coarse practice of sexual intercourse.
