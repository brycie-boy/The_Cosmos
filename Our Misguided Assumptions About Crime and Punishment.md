### Annotations

- based on the simple premise thatÂ [crime](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/law-and-crime "Psychology Today looks at crime")Â is largely a matter of poorÂ [decision-making](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/decision-making "Psychology Today looks at decision-making"). What would compel someone to deal drugs on a street corner, rob a grocery store, or steal a car? Our answers have been reflexive and nearly universalâ€”a bad decision or poor judgment. And the remedy has been nearly as reflexive and universal. How best to get someone to make better decisions in the future than to punish their bad behavior?


- First, the idea that crime is bad decision-making is logical, intuitive, and rings true. From the public's distant vantage point, this explanation makes sense.Â It also seems to make sense to key players in the administration of criminal justice, primarily prosecutors and judges, whose decisions reflect the logic of crime as poor judgment and punishment as the means to change offendersâ€™ thinking. After all, prosecutors and judges are lawyers, not psychologists, psychiatrists, or sociologists. They are not trained to think about human behavior beyond what they understand, which is often black and white such as that bad behavior deserves and needs punishment.

- So, how well have we been served by the assumption that crime is a matter of poor decision-making and that the appropriate remedy is punishment? The answer, unfortunately, is not well at all, despite the efforts of countless elected officials to tell us otherwise. Nearly all (85 percent) of those released from prison will be rearrested. It is actually higher than that since this only counts those who have been caught.

- For those concerned with cost, the news is not good either. We have spent $1 trillion dollars on being tough on crime and $1 trillion fighting a war on drugs. Recent efforts to monetize the broader social and economic impact of crime and criminal justice put the price tag at $1 trillion annually.

- I suggest that the sources of this failure are the assumptions we have about crime and criminality on the one hand, and punishment as the go to solution on the other. What we miss here are some hard facts about criminal offenders. Eighty percent of those in the American criminal justice system have a substance use disorder. Nearly 60 percent have a mental health problem. About 60 percent of prison inmates and 50 percent of probationers have had at least oneÂ traumatic brain injury. Then there is the issue ofÂ [comorbidity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/comorbidity "Psychology Today looks at comorbidity"), which is all too common among this population. The majority of criminal offenders come from poverty and disadvantage, commonly resulting in educational deficits, employment problems, homelessness and a variety of other circumstances.

- Much of crime spills over into the arena of public health. Using our jails and prisons as repositories for the mentally ill and those with significant cognitive dysfunction aggravates already seriousÂ [psychiatric](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychiatry "Psychology Today looks at psychiatric")Â and neurocognitive conditions.
