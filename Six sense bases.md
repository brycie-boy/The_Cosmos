## Six sense bases  #🧠 

The six internal and external sense bases provide a perspective on the totality of experience different from, but complementary to [[The five aggregates]]. The six pairs of sense bases are the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects, which support the arising of the respective type of [[consciousness]]. Becuase they mediate between [[consciousness]] and its objects, the internal sense bases are refered to as “the six bases of contact", contact being the coming together of sense faculty, object, and [[consciousness]]. The six sense bases and there respective types of [[consciousness]] consist of:

- eye, forms, and eye-[[consciousness]]
- ear, sounds, and ear-[[consciousness]]
- nose, smells, and nose-[[consciousness]]
- tongue, tastes, and tongue-[[consciousness]]
- body, tactile objects, and body-[[consciousness]]
- mind, phenomena, and mind-[[consciousness]]

What the first five sense bases signify is obvious enough, but the sixth pair, mind and phenomena present some difficulty. If the two terms are to be treated parellel to the other internal and external bases, we would understand the mind base to be the support for mind-[[consciousness]], and phenomena to be the objective sphere of mind-[[consciousness]]. On this interpertation, "mind" might be seen as the passive flow of [[consciousness]] from which active conceptual [[consciousness]] emerges, and phenomena simply as mental objects such as those apprehended by introspection, imagination, and reflection. The abhidhamma and Pali commentaries, however, interpret the two terms differently. They hold that the mind base comprises all six types of [[consciousness]]. They also hold that all actual entities not comprised in the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomena base then includes the other three mental aggregates—[[Sensation]], [[Conceptualization]], and [[Volitional formations]]—as well as types of subtle material form not experienced through the physical senses

[[The Nikayas]] suggest an interesting difference between the treatment of [[The five aggregates]] and the six sense bases. They both serve as the soil where clinging takes root and grows, but while [[the five aggregates]] are primarily the soil for [[Identity view]], the six sense bases are primarily the soil for craving. A necessary step in the conquest of craving is the restraint of the senses. Practitioners must be vigilant  in their encounters with pleasant and painful sense objects. When one is negligent, experience through the senses invariably becomes a trigger for craving and [[The three unwholesome roots]]; greed for pleasant objects, aversion from painful objects (and craving for pleasant escape routes), and dull attachment to neutral objects.
