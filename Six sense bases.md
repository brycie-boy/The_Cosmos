## Six sense bases  # 

The six internal and external sense bases provide a perspective on the totality of experience different from, but complementary to [[The five aggregates]]. The six pairs of sense bases are the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects, which suppoirt the arising of the respective type of consciousness. Becuase they mediate between conciousness and its objects, the internal sense bases are refered to as the "six bases of contact", contact being the coming together of sense faculty, object, and consciousness. The six sense bases and there respective types of consciousness consist of:

- eye, forms, eye-conciousness
- ear, sounds, ear-consiousness
- nose, smells, nose-consiousness
- tounge, tastes, tounge-conciousness
- body, tactile objects, body-conciousness
- mind, phenomena, mind-consiousness

What the first five sense bases signify is obvious enough, but the sixth pair, mind and phenomena present some difficulty. If it the two terms are to be treated parellel to the other internal and external bases, we would understand the mind base to be the support for mind consciousness, and phenomena to be the objective sphere of mind-consciousness. On this interpertation, "mind" might be seen as the passive flow of consciousness from which active conceptual conciousness emerges, and phenomena simply as mental objects such as those apprehended by introspection, imagination, and reflection. The abhidhamma and Pali commentaries, however, interpret the two terms differently. They hold that the mind base comprises all six types of consciousness. They also hold that all actual entities not comprised in the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomena base then includes the other three mental aggregates‚Äî[[Feelings]], [[Perceptions]], and [[Volitional formations]]‚Äîas well as types of subtle material form not implicated in experienced through the physical senses

[[The Nikayas]] suggest an interesting difference between the treatment of [[The five aggregates]] and the six sense bases. They both serve as the soil where clinging takes root and grows, but while the aggregates are primarily the soil for [[Identity view]], the sense bases are primarily the soil for craving. A necessary step in the conquest of craving is the restraint of the senses. Practitioners must be vigilant and maintaiin [[Mindfulness]] in their encounters with desirable and undesirable objects. When one is negligent, experience through the senses invariably becomes a trigger for craving; attraction towards desireable objects, and aversion from undesirable objects ([[The three unwholesome roots]]), and dull attachment to neutral objects.

In one of his earliest discources popularly known as "The Fire Sermon", [[the Buddha]] declared that "all is burning". The "all" is the six sense bases, their objects, the types of consciousness arisen from them, and the related contacts and feelings. The way to [[Nibbana]] is to see that this "all" is burning with [[The three unwholesome roots]] and disease. To dispell ignorance and generate true knowledge, we must contemplate the senses and the feelings that arises from through [[The three characteristics]]. This, according to [[The Nikayas]], is the direct way to the realization of [[Nibbana]]. An alternative route is to see teh senses as empty of a self or anything that belonging to a self.
