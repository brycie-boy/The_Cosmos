## Six sense bases  #🧠 

The six internal and external sense bases provide a perspective on the totality of experience different from, but complementary to [[The five aggregates]]. The six pairs of sense bases are the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects, which support the arising of the respective type of [[consciousness]]. Becuase they mediate between [[consciousness]] and its objects, the internal sense bases are refered to as “the six bases of impression", impression being the converging of sense faculty, object, and [[consciousness]]. The six sense bases and there respective types of [[consciousness]] consist of:

- eye, forms, and visual-[[consciousness]] (seeing)
- ear, sounds, and auditory-[[consciousness]] (hearing)
- nose, smells, and olfactory-[[consciousness]] (smelling)
- tongue, tastes, and gustatory-[[consciousness]] (tasting)
- body, tactile objects, and tactile-[[consciousness]] (touching)
- [[mind]], phenomena, and mental-[[consciousness]] (cognizing)

[[The Nikayas]] suggest an interesting difference between the treatment of [[The five aggregates]] and the six sense bases. They both serve as the soil where clinging takes root and grows, but while [[the five aggregates]] are primarily the soil for [[Identity view]], the six sense bases are primarily the soil for craving. A necessary step in the conquest of craving is the restraint of the senses. Practitioners must be vigilant  in their encounters with pleasant and painful sense objects. When one is negligent, experience through the senses invariably becomes a trigger for craving; greed for pleasant objects, aversion from painful objects (and craving for pleasant escape routes), and dull attachment to neutral objects.
