### Sources

##### 1. Broad Sources

These source types provide a broad context on a topic. These are good for expanding upon with tid bit sources, rather than jumping across tid bit sources and putting them together to understand a topic.

Tid bits can be deliberately sought out to expand upon a specific thing when a broad source isn’t elaborate enough on it. Or  it can be added within an inbox in which sources that seem interesting can be added and managed.

**📚 Books**

**⏯ Lectures**

**👨‍🏫 Courses**

##### 2. Tid Bits

These types of sources are for gaining smaller bits of insight from commentaries on a topic. These can be used for short introductions to topics but shouldn’t have notes taken on them until the broad source types are used.

**🌐 Articles / blogposts / social media posts**


**⏯ Video**

**🎙 Podcasts**

**✏️ Note Pad**

Used when on the go

- Jot down ideas that come to mind
- Jot down things you want to look further into but don’t have the time
- Jot down things I want to write about later

### Annotating System / Note Types
The things listed below are usually what I look for when consuming information. When capturing insights, I’m looking for what can be turned into notes.  I see these things as building blocks for content. Hence why they’re congruent with my notes types.

When capturing annotations, don’t worry about what the best things to annotate are. Instead, as you read, annotate anything that resonates or seems important. It’s better to annotate to much than too little. Later on within the inbox note, annotations will be organized or removed.
