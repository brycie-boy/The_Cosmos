### Source Types

##### 1. Broad Sources

-  add workflows for each type of source

Broad sources provide a broad overview of a topic. These are good for expanding upon with small sources, rather than jumping across small sources and putting them together to understand a broad topic.

**📚 Books**

**⏯ Lectures**

**👨‍🏫 Courses**

##### 2. Small Sources

These types of sources are for gaining smaller bits of insight on a broader topic. These can  be used as short introductions to topics, but small sources shouldn’t be studied until the broad source types are used. Small sources can be deliberately sought out and studied immediatly in order to expand upon a specific thing when a broad source isn’t elaborate enough on it. Or  it can be added within an inbox where sources that seem interesting can be added and managed to read later

### Annotating System / Note Types
The things listed below are usually what I look for when consuming information. When capturing insights, I’m looking for what can be turned into notes.  I see these things as building blocks for content. Hence why they’re congruent with my notes types.

When capturing annotations, don’t worry about what the best things to annotate are. Instead, as you read, annotate anything that resonates or seems important. It’s better to annotate to much than too little. Later on within the inbox note, annotations will be organized or removed.
