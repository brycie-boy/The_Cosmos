## Friendly weakness (phlegmatic) #üß† 

The friendly weakness type (the dependant neurotic) is one of [[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]]. It is a combilnation of the imprints of retreat and submission. Freindly weakness isd inclined to advance upon you, demanding fulfilment of emotinal "needs" (imprints). In the terminology of the medieval psychology of the four humors, this type is known as the phlegmatic humor. The phlegmatic humor was identified with the Angel archetype and [[The water element]]. These people are "too sensitive to fight" and "go with the flow". The [[Transactional Analysis]] system categorizes this type with the life script of "im not okay, you're okay".
