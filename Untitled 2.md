The [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] is intimetly connected with three dimensionality. Specifically, right-handedness is distictly a human trait, or at least primate trait. Other mammals show no right-handed prefrence and are ambidextrious. 

Neuroscience has demonstrated that our right-handedness is intimetly connected with our tendedcy to use the [[Left hemisphere]] of the brain more often than the [[Right hemisphere]]. Thus. there is a genetic (hardwired) preference in most humans for right-handed manipulations and [[left hemisphere]] mentations. Now these connections seem intimetly involved with the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] functions, since our [[left hemisphere]] is the "talking" brain, it is liner, analytical, and computer-like and verbal. Thus, there is a neurological linkage between mapping and manipulating. The right hand manipulates the universe (and makes artifacts) and the [[left hemisphere]] maps the results into a model, which allows for predictions about future behavior of that part of the universe. These are the distinctly human (postprimate) characteristics.
