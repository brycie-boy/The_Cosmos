## Information  # 

In mathematical information theory, information denotes the amount of unpredictability in a message; information is, roughly, what you do not expect to hear. In this sense, information may be "true" or "false", but it is always a pleasant surprise. The amount of resistance when confronted with new information measures the degree of Fundementalism in a culture, a sub-culture, or an individual.
