## The Oral Bio-Survival circuit acts entirely unconciously  # 

[[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is the oldest circuit of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]] in evolutionary development. Thus, it is the most mechanical and rapid. One is not conscious of time at all on the bio-survival circuit. The hardwired programs act automatically (unconsciously) because if you had to stop and think out every situation, you would be eaten by the first predator.
