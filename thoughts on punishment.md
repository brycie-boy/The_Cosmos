## thoughts on punishment  # 

Nature is the ultimate enforcer of justice. If a deed is bad, it will be met with consequences. We should not be arbitrators. If an action is harmful, then the actor will find out. We dont need to let them know in advance.

When people start to preach what is right or wrong, it only confuses people; they only have an arbitrary idea as to what is right and wrong based on second hand knowledge. The only thing we can do is advise. Wether someone decides to perform a bad deed is beyond our control. 

When people are punished for an action, their motivation to abstain from that paticular action is not because of its consequences, but because of the response it would create out of others.
