## The three unwholesome roots  #üß† 

The three unwholesome roots consist of:

- greed / attraction 
- hatred / repulsion 

The first two unwholesome roots are perpetuated by the third unwholesome root

- delusion / ignorance
   - that is, ignorance of [[The four nobel truths]]. 

Which, Inturn, they reinforce. The three unwholesome roots are what constitute craving.

From the three unwholesome roots arises a variety of secondary defilements. These include:

- anger
- hostility
- envy
- selfishness
- arrogance
- pride
- presumption
- laziness

From the root defilements and secondary defilements arise unwholesome actions.
