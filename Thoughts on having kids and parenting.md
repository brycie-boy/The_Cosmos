Many people treat having children like buying a new toy or a dog or something. They see everyone one else with there cute children and decide “I want one too”, and thus, they have a child.

After reproduction, there is little time for Circuit III speculations, and (because of the sanctions every tribe places upon “heresy,” i.e., new ideas) there is also little inclination. Thus, Circuit III tends to take us out of tribal cyclical time into linear progressive time; but Circuit IV loops us back into the cycle again. Homosexuals may or may not be the chief creators of cultural innovation, as some Gay Pride
