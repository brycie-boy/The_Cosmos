## Idol  # 

The term idol is what [[Robert Anton Wilson]] uses to refer to [[Perception]]s that are shaped by the fact that [[We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]]. When an Idol "speaks," generally through its "priests" it only says what the Faithful want to hear.
