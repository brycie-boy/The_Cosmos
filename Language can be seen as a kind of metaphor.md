## Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor  # 

When analyzing [[The stages of the perception process]], we can see that language can be seen as a kind of metaphor. The discovery of the metaphoric nature of language has its roots in the 19th century, and inspired [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]s famous dictum that "Language is fossil poetry". 

Thus, to want something is to be empty—want and vacant come from the same root. Speaking of all desires as "appetites" brings us back to the same metaphor. Even to be—the most abstact word in formal use—comes from an [[Indo-European]] root which evidently meant getting lost in the woods. That was abstact, i guess, as early  humans could feel; when no longer lost, when other people were found again, he or she would no longer simply "be" abstactly but become embroilled again in a more complex state, namley social existance with its [[Game Rules]]. 

A humorous story of sexual nature is a "dirty joke" because ascetics and puritans have left there own programs embedded within modern speech; but Saxon words for bodily functions are "dirtier" than Norman words because of a plurality of puritan-economic-economic prejudices. 

Even "the" can be seen as a metaphor—It assumes that the world is divided in the same way our minds divide it—and seems a very hypnotic metaphor indeed. In terms of human tragedy and suffering, think of what has been provoked by  generalizations such as "the Jews" or "the Blacks." More subtly, remeber that the phrase "the length of the rod" seemed to be a perfectly reasonable and objective phrase until [[Albert Einstein]] demonstated that a rod has various lengths depending on the velocity and also depending on the relative velocity of the perosn who is measuring it.
