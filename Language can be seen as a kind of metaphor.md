## Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor  # 

When analyzing [[The stages of the perception process]], language can be seen as a kind of metaphor. The discovery of the metaphoric nature of language has its roots in the 19th century, and inspired [[Ralph Waldo Emersons]] famous dictum that "Language is fossil poetry". 

Thus, to want something is to be empty—want and vacant come from the same root. Speaking of all desires as "appetites" brings us back to the same metaphor. Even to be—the most abstact word in formal use—comes from an [[Indo-European]] root which evidently meant getting lost in the woods. That was abstact, i guess, as early  humans could feel; when no longer lost, when other people were found again, he or she would no longer simply "be" abstactly but become embroilled again in a more complex state, namley social existance with its [[Game Rules]]. A humorous story of sexual nature is a "dirty joke" because ascetics and puritans have left there own programs embedded within modern speech; but Saxon words for bodily functions are "dirtier" than Norman words because of a plurality of puritan-economic-economic prejudices.
