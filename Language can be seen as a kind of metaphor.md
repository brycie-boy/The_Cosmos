## Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor  # 

The final stage of [[The stages of the perception process]] is verbal or symbolic and hence is coded into a pre-existing structure of languages systems that the brain has been previously taught. Thus we can see that language can be seen as a kind of metaphor. The discovery of the metaphoric nature of language has its roots in the 19th century, and inspired [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]s famous dictum that "language is fossil poetry". 

Thus, to want something is to be empty‚Äîwant and vacant come from the same root. Speaking of all desires as "appetites" brings us back to the same metaphor. Even to be‚Äîthe most abstact word in formal use‚Äîcomes from an [[Indo-European]] root which evidently meant getting lost in the woods. That was abstact, i guess, as early  humans could feel; when no longer lost, when other people were found again, he or she would no longer simply "be" abstactly but become embroilled again in a more complex state, namley social existance with its [[Game Rules]]. A villian, as the Marxists have pointed out, is a person without property. Man is a general human being, as Feminists point out, because of the gender bias in our language. A humorous story of sexual nature is a "dirty joke" because ascetics and puritans have left there own programs embedded within modern speech; but Saxon words for bodily functions are "dirtier" than Norman words because of a plurality of puritan-economic-economic prejudices.
