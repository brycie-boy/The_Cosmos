## The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit  # 

The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted in the "toddling" stage when the infant rises up, walks about and starts struggling for power within the family structure. This mostly mammillan circuit posseses territorial rules, emotional games or cons, pecking order, and rituals of domination or submission.
