## The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit  #üß† 

The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is concerned entirley with power politics. This circuit first appeared around 500 million to 1000 million years agp and is preserved in all territorial vertibrates. In modern humans, it seems to be centralized in [[The thalamus]]‚Äîthe "back brain" or the "old brain", and is linked to [[The voluntary nervous system]] and the muscles. This circuit appears in the newborn when the DNA master tape sends out RNA messenger molecules to trigger the mutation from neonate to "toddler", which involves first of all standing erect, walking, mastering gravity, overcoming physical obsticals, and learning to manipulate others politically are the vulnerable points in which imprinting and heavy conditioning occur. The muscles that perform these power functions are quickly programmed with what become chronic, life long reflexes. The mostly mammillan circuit posseses territorial rules, emotional games or cons, pecking order, and rituals of domination or submission. This circuit will organize itself into a strong, dominating role in the pack, or a weak, submissive role.If [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is cheifly imprinted by the mother. The Emotional-Territorial circuit is chiefly imprinted by the father-the nearest "alpha". The unwholesome deeds listed within [[The ten pathways of wholesome and unwholsome kamma]] can be said to be characteristic of this circuit. 

Status in the tribe is assigned according to preverbal signaling systems (kinesics) in which these muscle reflexes are crucial. All of the emotional games and cons listed in the popular psychological game-manuals of [[Dr, Eric Bern]] and the [[Transactional Analysis]]ts are second circuit imprints, or standard mammalian politics. The standard "domination" reflex is to swell the muscles and howl. You can see this in birds and mammals, as well as the local board meeting at the bank. The standard "submission" reflex is to shrink the muscles, lower the head, and "crawl away". You will find this among canines, primates, fowl and employees who wish to keep there jobs. 

In pre-ethological terms, the emotional-territorial circuit is what we usually call [[The ego]]. [[The ego]] is simply the recognition of one's status in the pack; it is a "role" as sociologists say. This circuit can also be said to be responsible for [[Identity view]].
