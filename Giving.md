## Giving #flashcard 

Giving serves to break down the egocentric frame of mind on the basisi of which we habitually interact with others. Or as the Buddha states "enobles and adorns the mind". 

Giving for early Buddhism did not mean simply philanthropic charity directed toward the poor and disadvantaged. While it does include this, the practice of giving is more context-specific. In indian religiosity, people who saught liberation gave up the household life to live a life of homelessness. Such homeless wanderers did not perform any remunerative services but depended on the charity of householders for there livelihood. Lay devotees provided them with their material requisites,  doing so in the confidence that such services were a source of merit that would help them advance a few steps further in the  direction of final liberation.
