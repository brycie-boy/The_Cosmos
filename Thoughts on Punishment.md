## Thoughts on punishment  # 

Punishment only suppresses desires, it doesn’t not eradicate them. The desire to commit certain actions persists and the individual will still do these things when given the chance. The individual isn’t afraid of the action, they’re afraid of the punishment

Is it not consieted to think we know better than nature?

The only true way to demotivate someone from doing something is to allow them to see through there own experience why something is or isn’t worth doing. 

Teaching lessons shouldn’t be a matter of punishing someone before they even commit the action “just in case”. We should not be the arbitrators as to what should or shouldn’t be done but should leave that 
consequences of the action itself, otherwise everyone is going to be left with arbitrary notions as to how they should conduct themselves.
