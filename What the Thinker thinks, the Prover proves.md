## What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves  # 

Acccording to psychotherapist [[Dr. Leonard Orr]], the mind is composed of to parts, the Thinker and the Prover. The Thinker can think about virtually anything. As psychiatrists and psychologists have often observed, the Thinker can think itself sick, and can even think itself well again. The Prover, however, operates on one law only: What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. 

If the Thinker thinks the sun revolves around the earth, the Prover will obligingly organize all perceptions to fit that thought: If the Thinker changes its mind and decides that the earth revolves around the sun, the Prover will reorganize the evidence. If the Thinker thinks that "holy water" from Lourdes will cure its lumbago, the Prover will skillfully orchestrait all signals from the glands, muscles, organs, etc. until they have organized themselves into good health again.

Of course, its fairly easy to see that other the minds of others operate in this fashion; It is comparativley much more difficult to become aware that one's own mind operates in the same manner. For instance, Scientists are believed to be "objective". No study of the lives of great scientists will confirm this. They are as passionate, and hence as prejudiced, as an assembly of great painters or musicians. It was not just the Church, but established astronomers of the time that condemed [[Galileo Galilei]]. The majority of physicists rejected [[Albert Einstein]]'s Special Theory of Relativity in 1905. Einstein himself would not exept anything in quantum theory after 1920 no matter how many ecperiments supported it. [[Thomas Edison]]'s commitment to Direct Current (DC) electrical generators led him to insist that [[NIkola Tesla]]'s alternating current (AC) generators were unsafe for years after their saftey had been proven.

Science achieves, or approximates objectivity, not because scientists are free from the psychological laws that govern the rest of us, but because of the [[Scientific method]]—a group creation—eventually overrides individual prejudices, in the long run. To give natorious example from the 1960s, there was a point when three research groups had "proven" that [[LSD]] caused [[Chromosome]] damage, while three other groups had "proven" that [[LSD]] had no effect on [[Chromosome]]s. In each case, the Prover proved what the Thinker thought.
