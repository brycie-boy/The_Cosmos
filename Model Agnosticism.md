## Model Agnosticism  # 

Model Agnosticism is a term coined by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] which refers to an attitude of mind which applies the agnostic principle not just to the "God" concept but to ideas of all sorts in all areas of thought and ideology. The agnostic principle refuses total belief or total denial and regards models as tools to be used only and always where appropriate and replaced (by other models) only and always where not appropriate. It does not regard any models, or any class of models, as more "profound" than any other models, or any class of models but asks only how a model serves, or fails to serve, those who use it. The agnostic principle is intended here in a broad "humanistic" or "existential" sense, and is not intended to be narrowly technical or philosophical only.
