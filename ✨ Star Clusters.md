## ✨ Star Clusters

Each note is given tags. Overtime, these tags accumulate notes and create a structure. Once a tag grows enough, it gets turned into its own note, which I call constellations. Each constellation contains links to each note containing the tag. Constellations provide a map for a subject, sort of like a table of contents, allowing for easier navigation.
