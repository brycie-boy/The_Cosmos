## Clinging to our personal beliefs gives rise to conflict and disputes  #🧠 

Clinging to sensual pleasure and material comfort is one trap that keeps beings bound to [[Samsara]]. Another trap is attachment to beliefs. [[We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]] and attachment to these views lead to one-sided, biased interpertations of reality that we cling to as accurate and complete. Such [[people have a tendency to become territorial over there ideologies and belief systems]] and those who tenaciously cling to their own views of a particular situation often come into conflict with those who view the same situation in a different light. Views thus give rise to conflicts and disputes. 

This is the idea behind of [[The Buddha]]'s famous parable of the blind men and the elephant. In this parable, [[the Buddha]] refers to a king who decided to round up all the blind men in the city. After doing so, the the king asked his servants to show the blind men an elephant. Each man was presented with a different part of the elephant. The king then asked the group of blind men ‘Tell me, blind men, what is an elephant like?’. Each of the men described the elephant in terms of the part they had been shown. These men, in there certainy, each stated “An elephant is like this, an elephant is not like that!" and proceeded to verbally and physically assult each other.
