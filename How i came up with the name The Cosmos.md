## How I came up with the name The Cosmos

According to wiki ‚ÄúThe cosmos is another name for the universe. Using the word _cosmos_ implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity‚Äù. I see the mind as a vast personal universe all to yourself. I created this in hopes of making my mind, or universe, a complex and orderly system rather than a chaotic one. 

This system is also in accordance with the natural order of nature.  It is a system that is interconnected and always evolving. It strives to create a learning experience that requires no excessive effort or clinging to ideas. The system works no faster or slower than what I can keep up with without straining,

This is why I made the first note [[üëÅ The Monad]]. Not only did the first little dot represent the monad symbol, but it also seemed to represent the concept of the monad in general. I wrote in the note the first verse of genesis because it represented the creation of a universe that was initially void of content.  I purposefully made the word ‚Äògod‚Äô lower case because it represented the creation of specifically my universe.

Also, the human brain functions thanks to its wide neuronal network that is deemed to contain approximately 69 billion neurons. On the other hand, **the observable universe is composed of a cosmic web of at least 100 billion galaxies**. Within both systems, only 30% of their masses are composed of galaxies and neurons.

The human brain visually resembles the structure of the universe as well. It was this fact and the graph in obsidian that initially inspired the name. I felt like it almost gave me a view of my neural pathways. Considering these things, I felt like The Cosmos was a perfect name.
