## Majors

- Major: Computer engineering 
	- Its a very versatile degree with lots of job opportunities. It can give me a chance to study math as well as develop a skill along the way. It seems pretty chill, free from a lot of propaganda and corruption like I see in other fields I’ve considered like psychology and medicine. Has a lot of room for creative expression
-  Minor: Neuroscience 
	- it seems like a more versatile way to study the mind. You see a lot of people applying Buddhism and mysticism to neuroscience unlike psychology. With neuroscience you can basically apply your own maps not just strictly psychology. It can also open doors to things like ai engineering and tech assisted learning

## Occupation ideas

- Work with neuroscience, psychology, psychedelics, yoga, magick, ai, geometry, cryptography, and technology assisted thinking and learning

	- “neuroscientists, medicinal chemists, computational experts, and drug development veterans”

- The EPRC
	- https://theeprc.org/
	- Buddhism is prominent here
	- “While each of our stories are different, their overall shape is very similar for most of us – being trained and working in our respective fields of inquiry while also having various emergent experiences that we knew were not well understood by science and clinical medicine but seemed to be described by various spiritual and religious traditions. Along the way, we all wrestled with the questions of how best to conceptualize and navigate the territory we found ourselves experiencing in order to appreciate the opportunities for growth and life enhancement that they offered while also realizing that some aspects of what was happening might be challenging in various ways.”
