## My main goals in life
1. Help people understand the symbolism of spiritual teachings, teach them that it’s not meant to be taken literally and show them what it really means. When people stop taking a materialistic look at art, they can understand it’s meaning and be able to express themselves in the same way
3. Then I want to show people that many traditions aren’t actually as different as we think they are and once we stop taking the symbolism literally then we can see this. I feel that since we do this. It creates unnecessary division between traditions
