## Themes and Phases
### 1.
I want to start off my music my music with a more Innocent vibe. I want it to sound very dreamy and ethereal. Itll have more fun lyrics. I want it to start with a beat that sounds like the booting up of a computer.
#### Insperations
1. Bladee - glue
2. Grimes
3. Sewerslvt

### 2.
Next, I want my music to sound more angry. I want to include more harsh, glitchy, distorted sounds. I want it to present my anger and frustration that I had toward the world and my circumstances. I think it should have a rebellious punk attitude to it. I want to include electric guitars and have a more. I want it to sound almost like I computer virus if that’s possible
#### Insperations
1. Death grips
2. Whole lotta red
3. Pop punk
4. Grunge

### 3.
Then I want to make more bleak and hopeless music. I want it to have a very cold, dreary, melancholic vibe. The lyrics will be very pessimistic  and hopeless. It’ll represent the depressive points of my life where I gave up hope. I want it to be very distopian. I want it to end with an ego death like song like kind of like death grips 2.0.  In which I transition into my next phase. I want it to sound like a slow computer. Like a dying or depressed robot. Or a cyberpunk city
#### Inspirations
1. Shoegaze
2. Bladee - Eversinse
3. Raid on SoundCloud
4. Sewerslvt


### 4.
For the next phase I want to my music to have a more spiritual and transcendental subject matter. I think I might make it sound more natural, minimal, maybe kind of indie. Like instead of electric guitars it would have acoustic. I want it to return to a more ethereal sound with a euphoric and blissful sound. It can also have very happy video gamey sounds. I want it to be about the peace that I eventually found. I want it to start like the first song with a computer rebooting beat
#### Inspirations
1. Bladee 333
2. Bladee the fool
3. Bladee exeter

### Notes
I want to maintain the digital, video game, futuristic, webcore sound throughout all my music. I want that to be my thing
