I donâ€™t think I can include psychedelics into my routine. What psychedelics do is forcefully shut off the ego. This can be useful occasionally, but my routine requires me to bring my ego on and offline throughout various times of the day, and psychedelics simply last too long.

This is what I want to be able to do easier anyways. I want to be able to quickly switch from doing something to relaxing, as well as switching from one task to another, without any attachment involved. 

Considering this. I think it will be much more useful to designate specific days to just take bigger doses
