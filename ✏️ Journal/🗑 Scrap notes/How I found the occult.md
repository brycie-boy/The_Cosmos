I was dissatisfied with psychotherapy which only seemed concerned with prescribing medication. So I started to learn about basic spirituality, meditation, ego death, etc. As I learned I started to remember some Bible verses and I would think “oh so that’s what that meant”. I started to wonder what other things in the Bible meant. I then started to notice symbolic parrelels with other religions. I started to see symbolism as a superior way of communicating vs abstraction. This started an interest in symbolism in general. As I started to learn more about symbolism, I started having a lot of synchronicities related to the symbolism. This all inevitably led me to the occult.

This wasn’t all a liner process tho. A lot of seemingly unrelated interests like the paranormal, art, conspiracy theories, etc all seemed to lead me here all around the same time. I would also just happen to meet people who just so happened to introduce me to certain things in the right place at the right time. That as well as all the synchronicities, it’s like the universe was nudging me to towards these ideas
