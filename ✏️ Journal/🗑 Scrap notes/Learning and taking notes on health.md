## Learning and taking notes on health ideas
- Follow what topics your interested in with health ie. longevity, brain health, etc. study that rather than individual foods, substances, or exercises. Study with goals or interests in mind. Make sure the thing relates to a topic of interest rather than just writing all about it. The contrary would be boring and possibly useless
- Don’t be too specific. Don’t write a new note for each paper or what ever. Write a general note like “keto may promote longevity” and include multiple sources similar to an web article. When learning about a particular thing, write about each benefit individually 
- Don’t just write about good things but also things to avoid
- Differentiate between things/terms ie, substances, processes, etc and points being made. Write different notes for each. Just like other notes, thing notes don’t have to be linked

Other:

- focus on secondary sources and how they express info and mimic them
