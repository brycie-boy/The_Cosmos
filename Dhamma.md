## Dhamma #🧠  

The word Dhamma is used by many Indian traditions and the meaning has evolved into various meanings over time as it was passed down from various traditions. The meaning can be different depending on the context in which it is used.

In Buddhism. Dhamma is often defined as "cosmic law", "phenomena", and "doctrine" or "disipline". Personally, i like to use the the word 'way', as i feel it encompasses the meaning of all the definitions.
