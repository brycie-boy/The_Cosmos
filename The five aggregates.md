## The five aggregates  # 

The five aggragates are five main categories used to analyze human experience. These five catagories are:

- [[The form aggregate]]
- [[The feeling aggregate]]
- [[The perception aggregate]]
- [[The volitional formations aggregate]]
- [[The consciousness aggregate]]

The examition of the five aggragates is critical to the [[Buddha]]'s teaching for atleast four reasons. The first is that the five aggregates are the ultimate adherent to the first nobel truth of the [[The four nobel truths]]. and since [[The four nobel truths]] revolve around suffering, understanding the five aggregates is critical for understanding [[The four nobel truths]] as a whole. Second, the five aggregates are the objective domain of clinging and as such contribute to the causal origination of future suffeing. Third, clinging to the five aggregates must be removed in order to attain liberation. And fourth, the kind of wisdom needed to remove clinging is clear [[Insight]] into the true nature of the aggregates.
