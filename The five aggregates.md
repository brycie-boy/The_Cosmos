## The five aggregates  #üß† 

The five aggragates are five main categories used to analyze sentient experience. These five catagories are:

- [[Form]]
- [[Sensation]]
- [[Conceptualization]]
- [[Volitional formations]]
- [[Consciousness]]

The examition of the five aggragates is critical to the [[Buddha]]'s teaching for at least four reasons. The first is that the five aggregates are the ultimate adherent to the first nobel truth. and since [[The four nobel truths]] revolve around dissatisfaction, understanding the five aggregates is critical for understanding [[The four nobel truths]] as a whole. Second, the five aggregates are the objective domain of clinging and as such contribute to the causal origination of future dissatisfaction. Third, clinging to the five aggregates must be removed in order to realize [[Nibbana]]. And fourth, the kind of wisdom needed to remove clinging is clear [[Insight]] into the true nature of the aggregates.

Because The five aggregates are the objective domain of clinging, they are commonly called the five aggregates subject to clinging. One either grasps them and takes possesion of them, that is, one appropriates them; or one uses them as the basis for views about oneself or for conceit ("I am better than, as good as, inferior to others") that is, one identifies with them. As [[The Nikayas]] put it, we are prone to think of The five aggregates thus: "this is mine, this i am, this is myself." The notion "this is mine" represents an act of appropriation, a function of craving. The notion "this i am" and "this is myself" represent two types of identification: the former expressing conceit, the latter expressing views.
