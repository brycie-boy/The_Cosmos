## The five aggregates  #🧠 

The five aggragates are five main categories used to analyze living experience. These five catagories are:

- [[Form]]
- [[Sensations]]
- [[Perceptions]]
- [[Volitional formations]]
- [[Consciousness]]

The examition of the five aggragates is critical to the [[Buddha]]'s teaching for at least four reasons. The first is that the five aggregates are the ultimate adherent to the first nobel truth. and since [[The four nobel truths]] revolve around dissatisfaction, understanding the five aggregates is critical for understanding [[The four nobel truths]] as a whole. Second, the five aggregates are the objective domain of clinging (see [[Identity view]]) and as such contribute to the causal origination of future dissatisfaction. Third, clinging to the five aggregates must be removed in order to realize [[Nibbana]]. And fourth, the kind of wisdom needed to remove clinging is clear [[Insight]] into the true nature of the aggregates.
