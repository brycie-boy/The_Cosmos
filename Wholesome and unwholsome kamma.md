## Wholesome and unwholsome kamma  #flashcard 

On the basis of ethical qualilty, kamma is distinguished into two major catagories. the wholesome and the unwholesome. Unwholesome kamma is an action that is afflictive to the agent, morally reprehensible, and brings painful results, or a hellish experience. It is kamma that ripens into misery and bad fortune.  The criterion for judging an action as unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots". There are three unwholesome roots:  

- greed/
- hatred/aversion
- delusion/ignorance

From there arises a variety of secondary defilements, such as:

- anger
- hostility
- envy
- selfishness
- arrogance
- pride
- presumption
- laziness

From the root defilements and secondary defilements arise defiled actions. Wholesome kamma is an action that is non-afflictive to the agent, morally commendable, brings pleasant results, or a heavenly experience. It is kamma that ripens into happiness and good fortune, or a heavenly experience. Its underlying motives are the three wholesome roots: 

- generosity
- loving-kindness
- wisdom
