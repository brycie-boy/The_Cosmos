## Paññā  # 

The word paññā is derived from the verbal root ñā (Skt: jñā), meaning to know, preceded by the prefix pa (Skt: pra), which mereley gives the word a more dynamic nuance. So paññā/prajñā means knowing or understanding, not as possession, but as an action: the act of knowing, the act of understanding, the act of discerning.

The Nikayas use paññā is not only as a point of doctrine but also as a theme for rich imagery. Paññā is refered to as a light and a knife. It is a light because it illuninates the true nature of things and dispels the darkness of ignorance. It is a knife because it cuts through the tangled mass of defilements and thereby leads to the realization of [[Nibbana]].
