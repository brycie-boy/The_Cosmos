## Scientific Method fallacy  # 

[[The Scientific Method]] is the path to certitude of waht the author [[Robert Anton Wilson]] calls [[The New Idol]]ators. [[The Scientific Method]] is a combination of sense data—usually aided by intruments to refine the senses—and the old Greek Pure Reason. Unfortunatley, while [[the Scientific method]] is powerfully effective, and seems to most to be the best method yet devised by mankind, It is composed of two elements fallable elements—sense data (see [[The external world that we percieve is a only the product of what the brain receives, edits, and classifies]]) and Pure Reason (see [[Pure Reason fallacy]]). Again, two fallabilities do not add up ot one. Scientific generalizations that have lasted a long time have _high probability_, perhaps the highest probability of any generalizations, but it is only [[The New Idol]]atry which claims that none of them will ever again have to be revised and rejected. Too many have been rejected in this century alone.
