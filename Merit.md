## Merit #🧠 

Merit is [[Wholesome kamma]] capable of yielding favorable results within [[Samsara]]. Merit produces mundane benefits such as a good rebirth, wealth, beauty, and success. It also serves as an enhancing condition for supramundane benefits, that is, for attaining the stages along the path to enlightenment. Merit is organized into the groups known as "the three bases of merit", which include:

- Giving (see [[Giving for merit]])
- [[Moral Disipline]]
- Meditation (see [[The four devine abodes]])
