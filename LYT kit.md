- Evergreen notes

- Most people take "just-in-time" notes. They take them for a specific short-term purpose‚Äîlike a test or a project. When the milestone concludes, the notes lose their value. That's "Churn and Burn".

- Evergreen note-_making_ is diametrically opposed to this type of short-term note-_taking_. Instead of losing value over time, evergreen notes are able to grow in value and evolve. That's "Know and Grow".

- Common properties of evergreen notes

- _Clear, Concise, & Distinct (Atomic)_ The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement. Formulating this one-liner clarifies and sharpens your thinking. And the hidden beauty is that this process naturally enforces an atomic note size‚Äîmeaning "one note = one idea".

- _Own Words & Unique Perspective_ Writing in your own words is yet another constraint that forces you to actually think about what you're trying to say. If your goals are to learn and grow your own thoughts over time, then your evergreen notes should be in your own words.

- _Non-static_ The modular, linkable nature of evergreen notes allows them to grow and evolve over time as you encounter anything that might relate to the note. In this way, your evergreen notes are like living entities‚Äîgaining in insights and complexity as time passes.

___

 Many evergreen notes should be statements with clear opinion. That's because it forces you to really think about what you're trying to say. However, these "clear opinions" need "clear things" to talk about! What are these "things"?

- "THINGS" like:

_Concepts_: which can and should stand on their own
_Known Things_: "The magna carta was signed in 1215"
_Standards_: Things with a pre-set language (whether that's programming, Things that follow a process, manuals, etc
    -   examples include anything from mathematical formulas, to the basics of language, to the process of putting a bike together
*Definitions, terms, topics, persons, places, or generally any other nouns

- these THING-based notes will naturally spawn ideas of your own that have clear opinions (or statements). For example:

The note on the `[[Magna Carta]]` (Clear Thing) can then link to a personalized note titled `[[No one is above the law]]` (Clear Opinion), which could link to another note titled `[[Protests can invoke radical change]]` (Clear Opinion).

A note on `[[Defining a variable]]` (Clear Thing) can link to a personalized note on `[[Understanding variables leads to higher level thinking]]` (Clear Opinion).

A note on the concept `[[Like begets like]]` (kinda both Clear Opinion and Fact) can link to the opinion `[[The neural formation of habits are additive]]` (Clear Opinion) and a bunch of other notes. See this example below:

- Linking your thinking encourages leaps of insights

- Something amazing happens when you start linking your digital notes. You develop the muscle to make leaps of insights across domains of knowledge. It's truly a super power‚Äîand a habit worth cultivating in today's age because "value" is created when strangers on a plane start talking.

- As you make rare and unique connections between different disciplines, you start to think more holistically about the underlying patterns inherent in both. These leaps of insight are not only fun, but they are all potential sources of new value creation (along with making you more interesting to interact with).

___

- Evergreen notes maximize reusability

- As the number of your evergreen notes grows over time, their value compounds into a priceless amalgamation of modular, agile thought-units.
