## Any ideas which we deem certain or factual are only conjectural and inferitial  # 

On the face of it, once we acknowledge that [[The external world that we percieve is a only the product of the brains interperting, editing, and classifying of it]], there seems to no escape form at least a partial [[Model Agnosticism]] and a recognition that all ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferitial. If [[Perception]] is not absolute, then no deduction from [[Perception]] can be absolute. No matter how ingeniously one juggles with approximations, they do not magically become certainties; at best, they only become the most accurate approximations. [[Aristotle]] escaped this conclusion, and until recently, most philosophers and scientists have followed, by asserting or assuming or _hoping_ that some method exists wherby the uncertanty of [[Perception]]s can be transended and we can arrive at certitude about general priciples.
