## Main sequence note titles are an abstraction for the note itself  # 

When notes are titled well, the title becomes an abstraction for the note itself. The entire notes ideas can be referenced using that handle. These titles are usually imparative or declarative sentences making a strong claim. This forces me to adequately support the claim in the body. If i struggle to title a note in such a way, it usually means that my thinking is muddy or the note is about several things. (contra [[Main sequince notes should be atomic]]) The solution in both cases is to break the note into the bits that i understand best.

I usually begin writing the note without knowing what the title is going to be. The title emerges out of the text written. When a note can be given a clear claim. that usually means it is starting to make sense
