## Contemplation of the four postures  # 

The contemplation of the four postures, a meditation subject of the [[Contemplation of body]], is explained below per the Buddha:

> “Again, monks, when walking, a monk understands: ‘I am walking’; when standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when sitting, he understands: ‘I am sitting’; when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down’; or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed.
