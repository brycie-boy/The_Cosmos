## The Non-Local Quantum Circuit  # 

The Non-Local Quantum Circuit,  one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted by shock, by "near death" or "clinical death" experience, and by [[Supernormal Powers]] such as [[Remote viewing]] which can be achieved through advanced yogas such as [[The fourth jhana]]. It tunes the brain into the non-local quantum communication system suggested by physicists such as [[Bohm]], [[Walker]], [[Sarfatti]], [[Bell]], etc.
