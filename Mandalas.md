## Mandalas  #üß† 

It can be obseved that the "extremes" of [[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]] can be expressed on [[The Leary Interpersonal Grid]] as a very off center pie slice.

Obviously an idealy "balanced" person‚Äîthat is, one not completely robotized and able to adjust to circumstances as they arise‚Äîwould not be so off centered. Such a person would be able to move a little bit into each quadrant when necessary, but would basically maintain a centered detachment between all of them. They could be graphed as a circle.

Circles of this sort, called _mandalas_, are widley used for meditation in the Buddhist tradition. Often they are cornered with four demons who represent the extremes to be avoided.
