## Moral values can only be validated when one experiences their benefits or consequences for themselves  # 

At the heart of our existential plight is the need for freedom from, harm, sorrow, and distress. Or expressed more positively, to achieve happiness and well-being. However, [[many doctrines promote ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them]], and in order to avoid pain and secure our well being, it is not sufficient to merely hope. According to [[The Buddha]], whatever arises, arises due to the appropriate causes and conditions. This applies with equal force to suffering and happiness. Thus we must ascertain the causes and conditions that lead to harm and suffering, and likewise the causes and conditions that lead to happiness and well being. Although [[The Buddha]]s teaching refers to the experience of suffering in future lives. We can use our present experience, backed by intelligent observation, as a criterion for determining what is beneficial and what is detrimental to our current lives.

In his discourse to the Kalamas, [[The Buddha]] proposes that [[No doctrine can be considered true until it has been validated personally]]. Rather than asking us to wrestle with issues that, in our present condition, no amount of experience can decide, he instead askes us to consider a few questions pertaining to our welfare and happiness, questions that we can answer on the basis of our own immidiate experience. Always underlying [[The Buddha]]s questions and the Kalamas replies is a tacit premise that people are primarily motivated to act though a concern for their own welfare. [[The Buddha]]s purpose in asking these questions is to lead the Kalamas to see that, even if we suspend all concern for future lives, [[The three unwholesome roots]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]] may eventually rebound to ones own harm and suffering right here and now.
