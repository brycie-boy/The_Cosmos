## Small Sources # flashcard 

Small sources are for gaining smaller bits of insight on a broader topic. These can aslo be used as short introductions to get a feel for a new topic, but shouldn’t be studied until the [[Broad Sources]] have been consumed. Small sources can be deliberately sought out and studied immediatly in order to expand upon a specific thing that you feel the  [[broad sources]] didnt elabortate well on. Or it can be added within an inbox for small sources that i come across which seem interesting and can be managed later.

There are 4 types of small sources that The Cosmos consumes:

🌐 **Texts**

- Articles
- Blog posts
