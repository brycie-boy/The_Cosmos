## Small Sources # flashcard 

These types of sources are for gaining smaller bits of insight on a broader topic. These can  be used as short introductions to topics, but small sources shouldn’t be studied until the broad source types are used. Small sources can be deliberately sought out and studied immediatly in order to expand upon a specific thing when a broad source isn’t elaborate enough on it. Or  it can be added within an inbox where sources that seem interesting can be added and managed to read later
