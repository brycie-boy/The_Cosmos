## The stages of the perception process  # 

The process of [[Perception]] consists of five stages. The first stage involves an object or event within the space-time continuum. In the Einsteinien sense, this can be a sub-atomic process, a horse running on a field, a movie projected onto a screen, the nuclear engine called "the sun" transmitting light and heat to us from 93,000,000 miles away, any other kind of event possible in space-time. This is often called [[Etic Reality]].

The transition from stage one to stage two involves part (not all) of the original energy from the object or event traveling toward one of the internal [[Six sense bases]]. 

The second stage involves the activity of the sense organ after impressed by part of the energy that reaches said organ. Note that not all of the energy is absorbed by the sense organ even in extreme cases, like when we are hit by a hammer, we still do not absorb all of the energy of the hammer. Even at this stage‚Äîeven if nothing was required for further [[Perception]]‚Äîwe we would still be dealing with part, not all; we would be dealing with absraction, uncertainty, fallibility.

The transition from stage two to stage three involves part of what happens after the sense organ is stimulated, by part of the energy flowing to us from the object or event. This period consists of very, very many signals traveling to many parts of our organism. 

The third stage involves the organismic reaction which can be quite complex. For instance, if the energy-packet happed to be "Your mother has been raped and murdered by terrorists" the stomach, tear ducts, and heart at least will be involved in processing the signal. as well as the neural and [[endocrine system]]s. It is obvious that with subtraction, [[Perception]] also involves an addition of pre-existing emotions, which is what psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]] meant by "projection."

The transition from stage three to stage four involves the transmission of all of this to the brain. Obviously, what the brain recieves is already highly colored by the subtractions and additions previously mentioned; but the brain itself, except perhaps in a newborn infant, already has a set preconfigured programs, or a "filing system" for organizing and classifying incoming signals.

The fourth stage involves the "percept", the mental "image" or "idea" that emerges  after the brain has processed the original energy dignals plus the addition and minus the subtractions. 

the transition between stage four and stage five invovles the most subtle and nefarious stage of all, the feedback between the incoming energy (plus additions and minus subtractions) and the language system which the brain happens to use habitually (including symbolic, abstract languages like mathematics). 

The fifth and final stage is always verbal or symbolic and hence is coded into pre-existing structure of languages systems the brain has been previously taught. This process is not one of linear reaction but of synergetric [[transaction]]. The finished product is a neurosemantic constuct and thus it can be said that [[Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]].
