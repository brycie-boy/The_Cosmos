## Mind  # 

Mind, and its objective sphere, phenomena, is the sixth pair of the [[Six sense bases]]. The mind base comprises all six types of consciousness arisen from impression between the internal and external [[Six sense bases]] and is also the passive flow of [[consciousness]] from which active conceptual [[consciousness]] emerges. All entities not cognized by the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomena base then includes the other three mental aggregates—[[Sensation]], [[Perception]], and [[Volitional formations]]—as well as "mental objects" such as those apprehended by introspection, imagination, and reflection.
