According to the Buddha’s teaching, the cosmos, with its many realms of sentient existence, is governed at all levels by immutable laws, physical, biological, psychological, and ethical. The process by which sentient beings migrate from one state of existence to another is likewise lawful.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2585
The governing factor in this process, the factor that makes the entire process a lawful one, is a force called kamma

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2586
The word “kamma” literally means action, but technically it refers to volitional action. As the Buddha says: “It is volition (cetanā) that I call kamma; for having willed (cetayitvā), one acts by body, speech, and mind.”

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2589
Such volition may remain purely mental, generating mental kamma that occurs as thoughts, plans, and desires; or it may come to expression outwardly through manifest bodily and verbal actions.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2592
all morally determinate volitional actions create a potential to bring forth results (vipāka) or fruits (phala) that correspond to the ethical quality of those actions. This capacity of our deeds to produce the morally appropriate results is what is meant by kamma. Our deeds generate kamma, a potential to produce fruits that correspond to their own intrinsic tendencies. Then, when internal and external conditions are suitable, the kamma ripens and produces the appropriate fruits.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2595
In ripening, the kamma rebounds upon us for good or for harm depending on the moral quality . This may happen either later in the same life in which the action was done, in the next life, or in some distant future life.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2625
The twin doctrines of kamma and rebirth enable us to see that the world in which we live is, in important respects, an external reflection of the internal cosmos of the mind. This does not mean that the external world can be reduced to a mental projection in the way proposed by certain types of philosophical idealism. However, taken in conjunction, these two doctrines do show that the conditions under which we live closely correspond to the karmic tendencies of our minds.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2628
The reason why a living being is reborn into a particular realm is because in a previous life that being has generated the kamma, or volitional action, that leads to rebirth into that realm. Thus, in the final analysis, all the realms of existence have been formed, fashioned, and sustained by the mental activity of living beings.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2631
“For beings obstructed by ignorance and hindered by craving, kamma is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture, for consciousness to be established in a new realm of existence—either inferior, middling, or superior”
(AN 3:76; I 223)

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2599
On the basis of its ethical quality, the Buddha distinguishes kamma into two major categories: the unwholesome (akusala) and the wholesome (kusala).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2600
Unwholesome kamma is action that is spiritually detrimental to the agent, morally reprehensible, and potentially productive of an unfortunate rebirth and painful results.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2757
“And what, monks, is dark kamma with dark results? Here, monks, someone generates an afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind. Having done so, he is reborn in an afflictive world. When he is reborn in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he experiences an afflictive feeling, extremely painful, as for example the beings in hell experience.
(Four Kinds of Kamma - Location 2754, AN 4:232; II 230–32)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2602
The criterion for judging an action to be unwholesome is its underlying motives, the “roots” from which it springs. There are three unwholesome roots: greed, hatred, and delusion. From these there arises a wide variety of secondary defilements—states such as anger, hostility, envy, selfishness, arrogance, pride, presumption, and laziness—and from the root defilements and secondary defilements arise defiled actions.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2605
Wholesome kamma, on the other hand, is action that is spiritually beneficial and morally commendable; it is action that ripens in happiness and good fortune.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2761
“And what, monks, is bright kamma with bright results? Here, monks, someone generates a non-afflictive volitional formation of body, speech, or mind. Having done so, he is reborn in a non-afflictive world. Being touched by non-afflictive contacts, he experiences a non-afflictive feeling, extremely pleasant, as for example the devas of refulgent glory experience. 
(Four Kinds of Kamma - Location 2754, AN 4:232; II 230–32)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2606
Its underlying motives are the three wholesome roots: nongreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion, which may be expressed more positively as generosity, loving-kindness, and wisdom.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2607
Whereas actions springing from the unwholesome roots are necessarily bound to the world of repeated birth and death, actions springing from the wholesome roots may be of two kinds, mundane and world-transcending. The mundane (lokiya) wholesome actions have the potential to produce a fortunate rebirth and pleasant results within the round of rebirths. The world-transcending or supramundane (lokuttara) wholesome actions—namely, the kamma generated by developing the Noble Eightfold Path and the other aids to enlightenment—lead to enlightenment and to liberation from the round of rebirths. This is the kamma that dismantles the entire process of karmic causation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2770
“And what, monks, is kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with neither dark nor bright results, which leads to the destruction of kamma? The volition to abandon this dark kamma with dark results, and to abandon the bright kamma with bright results, and to abandon the dark and bright kamma with dark and bright results
(Four Kinds of Kamma - Location 2754, AN 4:232; II 230–32)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2633
The next selection, Text V,1(2), draws a finer distinction among the types of unwholesome and wholesome kamma. The text enumerates ten primary instances of each class. Here they are called respectively “unrighteous conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma” and “righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma”

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2787
it is by reason of unrighteous conduct, conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, on the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. It is by reason of righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, that some beings here, on the breakup of the body, after death, are reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.”
(Why Beings Fare as They Do After Death - Location 2776, MN 41: Sāleyyaka Sutta; I 286–90)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2636
they are usually known as the ten pathways of unwholesome and wholesome kamma.5 The ten are subdivided by way of the three “doors of action”—body, speech, and mind.

You want long life, health, beauty, power, riches, high birth, wisdom? Or even some of these things? They do not appear by chance. It is not someone's luck that they are healthy, or another's lack of it that he is stupid. Though it may not be clear to us now, all such inequalities among human beings (and all sorts of beings) come about because of the kamma they have made individually. Each person reaps his own fruits. So if one is touched by short life, sickliness, ugliness, insignificance, poverty, low birth or stupidity and one does not like these things, no need to just accept that that is the way it is. The future need not be like that provided that one makes the right kind of kamma now. Knowing what kamma to make and what not to make is the mark of a wise man. It is also the mark of one who is no longer drifting aimlessly but has some direction in life and some control over the sort of events that will occur.

___

merit (puñña), wholesome kamma capable of yielding favorable results within the cycle of rebirths.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2688
Merit produces mundane benefits, such as a good rebirth, wealth, beauty, and success. It also serves as an enhancing condition for supramundane benefits, that is, for attaining the stages along the path to enlightenment. Hence, as seen in Text V,2(1), the Buddha urges his disciples to cultivate merit, referring to his own cultivation of merit over many previous lives as an example.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2690
The Nikāyas concisely organize the types of merit into three “bases of meritorious deeds” (puññakiriyavatthu): giving, moral discipline, and meditation.

3. GIVING

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2702
giving serves to break down the egocentric frame of mind on the basis of which we habitually interact with others.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3018
‘By giving this gift, I shall be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world, after death’; or with the thought, ‘When giving this gift, my heart will be glad, and happiness and joy will arise in me’; or one gives because it ennobles and adorns the mind.”
(Reasons for Giving Location 3015, AN 8:33; IV 236–37)

- Highlight(pink) - location 2704
“giving” for Early Buddhism does not mean simply philanthropic charity directed toward the poor and disadvantaged. While it includes this, the practice of giving has a more context-specific

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2705
rooted in the social structure of Indian religiosity.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2709
Such homeless wanderers, known as samaṇas (“ascetics”) or paribbājakas (“wanderers”), did not perform any remunerative services but depended upon the charity of householders for their livelihood. The lay devotees provided them with their material requisites—robes, food, lodgings, and medicines—doing so in the confidence that such services were a source of merit that would help them advance a few steps farther in the direction of final emancipation.

The Uposatha Observance

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2729 
While the Buddha enjoins observance of the five precepts upon lay followers as a full-time obligation, he recommends a more stringent type of moral practice for the uposatha, the observance days determined by the lunar calendar: the full-moon day, the new-moon day, and the two half-moon days. (Of the four, in Buddhist countries today it is the full-moon day that is given priority.) On these occasions, devout lay Buddhists undertake eight precepts: the usual five, but with the third changed to complete sexual abstinence, augmented by three other precepts that emulate the training rules of a novice monk or nun. 

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3108
“‘As long as they live the arahants abandon sexual relations and observe celibacy, living apart, refraining from the coarse practice of sexual intercourse.
(The Uposatha Observance Location 309, AN 8:41; IV 248–51)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3114
“‘As long as they live the arahants eat only one meal a day and refrain from eating at night, outside the proper time.
(The Uposatha Observance Location 309, AN 8:41; IV 248–51)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3117
“‘As long as they live the arahants abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and unsuitable shows, and from adorning themselves by wearing garlands and applying scents and ointments.
(The Uposatha Observance Location 309, AN 8:41; IV 248–51)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3119
“‘As long as they live the arahants abandon the use of high and luxurious beds and seats and abstain from using them; they make use of low resting places, either small beds or straw mats.
(The Uposatha Observance Location 309, AN 8:41; IV 248–51)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2733
The eight precepts, enumerated in Text V,4(2), augment the training in sīla as a moral observance with a training in self-restraint, simplicity, and contentment. In this respect they prepare the disciple for the training of the mind undertaken in the practice of meditation, the third base of merit.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2735
The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to liberation but a source of merit in its own right. Wholesome meditation practices, even those that do not directly lead to insight, help to purify the grosser levels of mental defilement and uncover deeper dimensions of the mind’s potential purity and radiance.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3156
The Four Divine Abodes
 
- Highlight(pink) - Location 2738
Text V,5(1) declares that the type of meditation that is most fruitful for the production of mundane merit is the development of loving-kindness (mettābhāvanā). The practice of loving-kindness, however, is only one among a set of four meditations called the “divine abodes” (brahmavih̄ra) or “immeasurable states” (appamaññ̄): the development of loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity, which are to be extended boundlessly to all sentient beings.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 3114
“Monks, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by loving-kindness.
(The Development of Loving-Kindness location 3143, It 27; 19–21)

equanimity
(The Four Devine Abodes location 3156, MN 99: Subha Sutta; II 206–8)

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2744
These meditations are said to be the means to rebirth in the brahma world;

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2745
While the brahmins regarded the brahma world as the highest attainment, for the Buddha it was just one exalted sphere of rebirth.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2746
The concentration arisen from these meditations, however, can also be used as a basis for cultivating the wisdom of insight, and insight culminates in liberation.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2479
Then, at the very end, it declares that the most fruitful deed among them all is the perception of impermanence. The perception of impermanence, however, belongs to a different order. It is so fruitful not because it yields pleasant mundane results within the round of rebirths, but because it leads to the wisdom of insight that cuts the chains of bondage and brings the realization of complete emancipation, Nibbāna.

___

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2692
In the Indian religious context, the practice of meritorious deeds revolves around faith in certain objects regarded as sacred and spiritually empowering, capable of serving as a support for the acquisition of merit. For followers of the Buddha’s teaching these are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2645
The Buddhist cosmos is divided into three broad realms—the sense-sphere realm (kāmadhātu), the form realm (rūpadh̄tu ), and the formless realm (arūpadhātu)—each comprising a range of subsidiary planes.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2647
The sense-sphere realm, our realm, is so called because the beings reborn here are strongly driven by sensual desire.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2648
The realm is divided into two levels, the bad destinations and the good destinations.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2648
The bad destinations or “states of misery” (apāya) are three in number: the hells, states of intense torment (see MN 129 and 130, not included in this anthology); the animal kingdom; and the sphere of spirits (pettivisaya ), beings afflicted with incessant hunger, thirst, and other sufferings.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2652
The good destinations in the sense-sphere realm are the human world and the six sensual heavenly planes.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2653
The latter are: the devas in the heaven of the Four Great Kings, who are presided over by four powerful devas (namely, the Four Great Kings); the Tāvatiṃsa devas presided over by Sakka, a devotee of the Buddha who is faithful but prone to negligence (see the Sakkasaṃyutta, SN chapter 11); the Yāma devas; the devas of the Tusita heaven, the abode of a bodhisatta before his final birth; the Nimmānaratī devas (“the gods who delight in creating”); and the Paranimmitavasavattī devas (“the gods who control what is created by others”).

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2657
In the form realm the grosser types of material form are absent. Its denizens, known as brahmās, enjoy bliss, power, luminosity, and vitality far superior to the beings in the sense-sphere realm

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2659
The form realm consists of sixteen planes. These are the objective counterparts of the four jhānas.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2659
Attainment of the first jhāna leads to rebirth among Brahmā’s assembly, the ministers of Brahmā, and the Mahābrahmās, according to whether it is developed to an inferior, middling, or superior degree.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2661
The second jhāna, attained in the same three degrees, leads respectively to rebirth among the devas of limited radiance, of measureless radiance, and of streaming radiance.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2662
The third jhāna, attained in the same three degrees, leads respectively to rebirth among the devas of limited glory, of measureless glory, and of refulgent glory.

- Highlight(pink) - Location 2663
The fourth jhāna ordinarily leads to rebirth among the devas of great fruit, but if developed with a feeling of disgust for perception, it will conduce to rebirth among the “nonpercipient beings,” beings who lack perception.
