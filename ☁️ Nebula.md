“And the earth was void without form”

Nebulas are what i call my inbox notes. Nebulas consist of 2 stages:

- **💥 Supernova**
	
     This is what i call my unprocessed inbox notes. All the annotations i collect during [[Ingestion]] are copied onto an inbox scrap note. These annotations are of little informational value, they are atomized, scattered, and unrelated. This is fine. Think of it as a reminder saying "hey, look at this passage".
	
     When processing these annotations you'll want to be able to see the big picture and see clusters of ideas. I cluster annotations by copying the annotations from the inbox scrap into an actual inbox note and sort them into clusters as I go through them. Clusters do not have to follow the structure of the original source. Annotations can be clustered in what ever way makes sense to you. These clusters, when organized, are then written into [[⛅️ Proto Note]]s

- **☁️ Nebula**
	
	 When the chaos of the supernova subsides, and gravity has condensed all the atomized annotations into [[☀️ Main-Sequence Note]]s, then the inbox note is processed, and thus receives the status of nebula.
