## The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit  #üß† 

The [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]]s domination/submission imprints create a two demensional social space in conjection with the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]]s advance/retreat imprints. The grids of the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and the [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] thus create four quadrents. These are: 

- [[Hostile weakness (choleric)]]
- [[Friendly weakness (phlegmatic)]]
- [[Hostile strength (bilius)]]
- [[Friendly strength (sanguinary)]]

These four types are further subdivided in [[The Leary Interpersonal Grid]].

These imprint types and their respective symbols go back a long way. Cabalists find them in the old testament, where the lion-angel-bull-eagle appear in Ezekiel. They are found constantly in catholic art, assosiated with the four evangelists: Mathew-angel, Mark-lion, Luke-bull, and John-eagel. They also run all through the [[Tarot]] card decks, medieval and modern.
