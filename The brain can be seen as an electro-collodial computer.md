## The brain can be seen as an electro-collodial computer  #üß† 

The brain can be seen as sort of a bio-computer‚Äîan electro-colloidal computer, as distict from solid state compters that exist outside of our heads. The brain appears to be made up of matter in electro-colloidal suspension (protoplasm). Colloids are pulled together, through a condition of gel, by there surface tensions. This is becuase surface tensions pull all glue-like substances together. Colloids are, conversly, pushed apart, toward a condition of sol, by there electrical charges. This is because their electrical charges are similar, and similar electrical charges repel each other. In the equilibrium of gel and sol, the colloidal suspension maintains its continuity and life continues. Move the suspension too far toward gel, or too far towards sol, and life ends.

Any chemicals that enter the brain changes the gel-sol balance, and [[consciousness]] is influnced accordingly. Thus, potatoes are, like LSD, "psychedelic"-in a milder way. Since [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]], all of our ideas are psychedelic. Even without experimenting with diet or drugs, what you think you should see, you will see-unless it is physically impossible in this universe.
