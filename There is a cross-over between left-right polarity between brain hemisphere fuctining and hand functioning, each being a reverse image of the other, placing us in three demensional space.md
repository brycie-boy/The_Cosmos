## There is a cross-over between left-right polarity between brain hemisphere fuctining and hand functioning, each being a reverse image of the other, placing us in three demensional space  # 

The [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] is intimetly connected with three dimensionality. Specifically, right-handedness is a distinct human trait, or at least primate trait. Other mammals show no right-handed prefrence and are ambidextrious. 

Neuroscience has demonstrated that our right-handedness is intimetly connected with our tendedcy to use the [[Left hemisphere]] of the brain more often than the [[Right hemisphere]]. Thus, there is a genetic (hardwired) preference in most humans for right-handed manipulations and [[left hemisphere]] mentations. Now these connections seem intimetly involved with the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] functions, since our [[left hemisphere]] is the "talking" brain, it is liner, analytical, and computer-like and verbal. Thus, there is a neurological linkage between mapping and manipulating. The right hand manipulates the universe and makes artifacts, and the [[left hemisphere]] maps the results into a model, which allows for predictions about future behavior of that part of the universe. These are the distinctly human (postprimate) characteristics.

The left hand, on the contrary, specializes in [[Right hemisphere]]ic funtions, which are holistic, supra-verbal, "intuitive", musical, and "mystical". [[Leonardo Davinci]], [[Ludwig Beethoven]], and [[Fredrick Neitzsche]], for instance, were all left handed. Traditionaly, left handed individuals have been subject to both dread and awe‚Äîregarded as stange, shamanic, and probably in special communication with "God" or "Satan". [[Aleister Crowley]] knew about this intuitivley, before modern neuroscience, and taught his pupiis to write well equally with both hands, thereby forcing the dormant [[Right hemisphere]]ic functions into action.

There is a cross-over between left-right polarity between brain hemisphere fuctining and hand functioning, each being a reverse image of the other:

The double (and reversed) left-right polarity places us neurologically in three dimensional space. Adding this aspect to the two dimensional diagram of the first two circuits (the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and the [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]]), we can illustrate the mind feild as follows:

This is "Euclidean" space. It is obvious, in this context, why euclidean space was the first kind of space discovered by mathmeticians and artists, and why it seems "natural" to us; that is, why some have great difficulty in imagining the non-Euclidean kinds of space used in modern physics. Euclidean space is a projection outward of the way our nervous systems stacks information on the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]], [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]], and [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]].

Thus, the imrint sites for the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] are located within the left [[Cerebral Cortex]] and closely linked with the delicate muscles of [[Larynx]] and the fine manipulations of right-handed ‚Äúdexterity". The [[Cerebral Cortex]] itself is so recent in evolution that it is often called ‚Äúthe new brain‚Äù; it is found only in the higher mammals and is most developed in humans and cetaceans (dolphins and whales).
