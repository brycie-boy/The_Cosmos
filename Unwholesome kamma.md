## Unwholesome kamma  #🧠 

Unwholesome [[kamma]] is an action that is harmful to the agent, morally reprehensible, and brings painful fruits. It is [[kamma]] that ripens into bad fortune and misery, or a "hellish experience". The criterion for judging [[kamma]] as unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots"; these are [[The three unwholesome roots]].
