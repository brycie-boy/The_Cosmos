## Unwholesome kamma  #üß† 

Unwholesome [[kamma]] is an action that is harmful to the agent, morally reprehensible, and brings painful fruits. It is [[kamma]] that ripens into bad fortune and misery, or a hellish experience. The criterion for judging [[kamma]] as unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots". There are three unwholesome roots:  

- greed
- hatred
- delusion

From there arises a variety of secondary defilements, such as:

- anger
- hostility
- envy
- selfishness
- arrogance
- pride
- presumption
- laziness

From the root defilements and secondary defilements arise unwholesome [[kamma]]. as seen in [[The ten pathways of wholesome and unwholsome kamma]].
