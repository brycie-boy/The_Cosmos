## Heading #flashcard 

Whereas kamma springing from unwholesome roots are bound to the world of repeated birth and death, kamma springing from wholesome roots may be of two catagoties, the mundane and the supramundane. The mundane kamma have the potential to produce a fortunate rebirth within the round of rebirths. The supramundane wholesome kamma is the volition to abandon kamma with wholesome results and kamma with unwholesome results and is generated by developing the Nobel Eightfold Path and the other aids to enlightenment, leading to liberation from the round of rebirths. This is the kamma that dismantles the entire karmic process.
