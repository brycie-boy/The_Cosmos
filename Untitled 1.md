## Heading #flashcard 

The twin doctrines of kamma and rebirth enables us to see that the world that we live in is  essentially an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind. The reason why a living being is reborn in a paticular realm is because in a previous life that being has generated the kamma. Thus, all the realms of existance have been formed, fashioned, and sustained by the mental activity of living beings.
