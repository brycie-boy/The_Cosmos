[[The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]]s domination/submission creates a two demensional social space in conjection with [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]]s advance/retreat. The grids of [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and [[The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] thus create four quadrents.

- retreat + dominant = area of hostile weakness(the paranoid)
- retreat + submissive = area of freindly weakness (the dependant neurotic)
- advance + dominant = area of hostile strength (the tyrant)
- advance + submissive = area of friendly strength (the good parent)

Hostile strength (the tyrant) is inclined to paranoid withdrawl: he must govern, but he is also afraid. Freindly weakness is not in retreat at all, he or she advances upon you, demanding fulfilment of emotinal "needs" (imprints).

These four quadrents have been known since the dawn of self-consciousness. For instance, in the terminology of the medieval psychology of "humors". Thse four imprint types are known as:

- choleric humor (hostile weakness)
- phlegmatic humor (friendly weakness)
- bilius humor (hostile strength)
- sanguinary humor (friendly strength)

The sanguinary type (friendly strength) was identified with the Lion archytype and [[The fire element]]. The Lion archytype becuase the dignity of these big cats represents the "good" strength, and fire represents power. The phlegmatic type, (friendly weakness) was identified with the Angel archetype and [[The water element]]. These people are "too sensitive to fight" and "go with the flow".
