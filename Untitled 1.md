## Heading  # 

It has been proposed by sociologist [[G. Rattray Taylor]] that societies swing back and forth between "matrist" periods, in which the motherly values of [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] predominate, and "patrist" periods, in which the fatherly values of [[The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] are in assendance. Taylors table of the characteristics of these "Matrist" and "Patrist" values are as follows:

Matrist: 

- Pessimisive towards sex
- Freedom for women
- Women have high status
- Chastity not valued
- Egalitarian
- Progressive
- No distrust of research
- Spontaneous
- Sex differences minimized
- Fear of insest
- Hedonic
- Mother Goddess

Patrist:

 - Restrictive towards sex
 - Limitation of freedom for women
 - Women have low status
 - Chastity valued
 - Authoritarian
 - Conservative
 - Distrust of research
 - Inhibitous 
 - Sex differences maximized
 - Fear of homosexualy
 - Asetic
 - Father god

Wether or not societies wobble between these two extremes as Taylor claims, individuals certainly do. These are merely consequences of (a) having the heaviest imprint on [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] (Matrist), and (b) having the heaviest imprint on [[The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] (Patrist).
