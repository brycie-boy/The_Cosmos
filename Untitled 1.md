We as a species are still in a primitive stage of evolution and conditions on this planet are quite harsh. Radical pediatritions insist that child birth by conventional means is usually traumatic for the infant—creates a bad imprint on [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]]. Our child rearing methods are far from ideal also, adding bad imprinting on top of bad conditioning. And in general the violence of societies to date—including wars, revolutions, civilwars, etc.—keeps [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] of most people on an emergency state far too much of the time. In 1968, a U.S. Public Health survey showed that 85% of the population had one or more symptoms that we would call bad imprinting or conditioning od [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]]. These symptoms included dizzy spells, heart palpitations, wet palms and frequent nightmares.

Since [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is the most rapid. Most people, thus, are almost as mechanical as robots. A man or woman entering a new situation with anxiety chemicals of a frightned newborn coursing through [[The brain stem]]—ie. [[Adrenaline]] and [[Adrenalutin]], which signal the whole organism to prepare to fight or flee.— are not going to be able to decern, investigate, judge or decide anything very skillfuly. And this is why [[George Gurdjieff]] said, in his own jargon, that people are asleep and having nightmares. “FAIRNESS? DECENCY? HOW CAN YOU EXPECT FAIRNESS OR DECENCY ON A PLANET OF SLEEPING PEOPLE?”. This was the viewpoint of the earliest Christians, the Gnostics, later condemned as heretics by the Roman bureaucrats. The Gospel of Truth, first century, says bluntly that history is a nightmare:

> . . . as if (mankind) were sunk in sleep and found themselves in disturbing dreams. Either (there is) a place to which they are fleeing . . .or they are involved in striking blows, or they are receiving blows themselves . . . sometimes it is as if people were murdering them . . . or they themselves are killing their neighbors . . . 

Actions of this nature, that is, of a bad [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] imprint, are further enumerated by Buddhists as [[The ten pathways of wholesome and unwholsome kamma]].

To these first Christians, as to the Buddhists, awakening literally meant coming out of this nightmare of impulsive tendencies. In other words, it means correcting the editing that causes us to behave and perceive like inappropriately wired robots and suddenly seeing the unedited world.
