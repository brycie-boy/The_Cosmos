## Heading  # 

[[The four imprint types of the bio-survival circuit and the emotional-territorial circuit]] are not meant to be rigid or to imply that there are only four possible types of humanoid robots. The later circuits of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]] can modify all this considerably. It is important to understand that the four archetypes are for convience only. Each quadrant can be subdivided much more sharply, if necessary for diagnostic purposes.  For instance, an influental psychological test, The Leary Interpersonal Grid, divides the four quadrants into sixteen sub-quadrants and allows one to grade each in terms of moderate to ecxessive tendancy to behave that way.
