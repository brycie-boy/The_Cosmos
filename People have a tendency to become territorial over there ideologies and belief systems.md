## People have a tendency to become territorial over there ideologies and belief systems  # 

Human beings seem to be very unique primates, but primates nontheless. Specifically, the usual primate program of territory and property can be seen mirrored in any human community in the plethora of "NO TRESPASSING" signs. [[We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]] and due to humans unique capacity to learn neurosemantic systems, it becomes possible for them to "own" their comforting symbolic territories just as they would physical territory. Human beings battle over not only physical territory but also of these "mental" or neurosemantic territories. 

- [[Clinging to our personal beliefs gives rise to conflict and disputes]]

If a donkey kicks a donkey, thats a matter between two donkeys, but if a Spaniard kicks the king of France, then all citizens who follow their countries local [[Reality tunnel]] become involved in the territorial frenzy known as "war." This will be preceeded by a great deal of signals such as "national honor," "an unforgivable outrage," "our duty to our nation," "cowardly appeasers who would crawl on their bellies," etc. etc. These "noises" are as real and meaningful to those in that [[Reality tunnel]], as the "noises" of [[Ludwig Beethoven]]s Ninth are to those in the classical music [[Reality tunnel]].
