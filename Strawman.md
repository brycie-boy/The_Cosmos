## Strawman #flashcard 
A straw man argument attacks a different subject rather than the topic being discussed. The purpose of this misdirection is to make one's position look stronger than it actually is.

The straw man argument is appropriately named after a harmless, lifeless scarecrow. Instead of contending with the actual argument, they attack the equivalent of a lifeless bundle of straw — an easily defeated puppet that the opponent was never arguing for in the first place.
