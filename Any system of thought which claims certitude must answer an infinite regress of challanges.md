## Any system of thought which claims certitude must answer an infinite regress of challanges  # 

[[When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challanges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain]]. thus a "common sense" attitude to any propositions of this nature would be consider them absurd and discard them. But any system which claims certianty must answer all challanges. Since this would take an infinite amount of time, it has not yet been performed, and the foundations of every mathematical-logical systems today are increasingly considered formal [[Game Rules]] and not eternal "laws of thought" as they seemed to be in the west from [[Aristotle]] to about the time of [[Immanuel Kant]].

In daily life and in "common sense" we maintain this degree of [[Model Agnosticism]] and "expect the unexpected" and "keep our eyes and ears open," etc. We only rush to conclusions when we are under time pressure to make a quick decision or when prejudices are involved, as in religous or political controversy. When there is no existensial pressure for quick decisions, only prejudice asserts certitude.
