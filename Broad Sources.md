## Broad Sources 

Broad sources are sources that provide a broad overview of a topic or subject. They're a good frame work for deciding what [[small sources]] you want to find and use to build upon what has been learned through the broad source. [[Small Sources]] within the internet are very scattered and atomized, usually starting in the middle of a topic without context, which makes it difficult to develop a cohesive understanding, leaving you trying to put these fragmented bits together, something you wouldn't have to deal with the structured frame work that a broad source would provide. I usually try to look for these types of sources when i want to dive deeper into a new subject.

There are 3 types of broad sources that the Cosmos consumes:

**📚 Books**

**⏯ Lectures**

**👨‍🏫 Courses**

As well as any other large source that can’t be read through and studies quickly
