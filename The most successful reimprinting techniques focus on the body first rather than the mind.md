## The most successful reimprinting techniques focus on the body first rather than the mind  # 

[[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is unconscious in three ways; it is unconscious because it is automatic: it happens without thought, as a robot program; It is uncounsious because it began before the infant understood language and hence is non-verbal, innarticulate, and felt rather than understood; and it is unconscious becuase it is all-over-the-body-at-once. Specifically, it is characterised by the Resperatory Block first noted by [[Wilhelm Reich]]; a chronic muscular armouring that prevents proper relaxed breathing. All of the most successfull reimprinting techniques for this kind of chronic anxiety focus on the body first, not the "mind". [[Konrad Lorenz]] aquired his insights on the imprinting process by consciously imitating the body movements of the animals he was studying. Similarly, [[Wilhelm Reich]] found that he could understand the condition of his patients with remarkable clarity by imitating their bodily movements and postures. This is why all schools of yoga‚ÄîBuddhist, Hindu, Sufi‚Äîemphasize restoring natural breathing before they move the student towards the higher circuits of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]]. An example of such a practice within the Buddhist tradition would be the [[mindfulness of breathing]] exersize, in which one "breaths in tranquilizing the bodily formation", that is, one slows the breath and thus calms the body. Another would be the  the development of [[Serenity]].

Even old fashioned M.D.s who won't consider holistic ideas for a second, admit that some people are just "more suseptible" to disease. what could this metaphysical "suseptability" be? Anthropologist [[Ashley Montagu]] has collected multiple statistics over the years on children who were deprived of maternal love at a critical point of imprint vulnerablility. Not only were they more likely to die at a younger age than the national average. They were often sicklier all their lives and even grew to be several times shorter than the average height for their sex. What makes for "suseptabililty" (besidies possible genentic factors) can only be such chronic anxiety (muscle tension) on the [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]].

Christian Science‚Äîand any other religion that dogmatically insists that "God" wants us to be happy and successful‚Äîcan cure such conditions "meraculously". [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]. Absolute faith that "God" is supporting you, beamed out from the brain all day long, day after day, signals the muscles to relax, and natural bouyancy and health returns
