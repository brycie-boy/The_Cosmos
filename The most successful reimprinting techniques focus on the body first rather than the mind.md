## The most successful reimprinting techniques focus on the body first rather than the mind  # 

[[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is unconscious in three ways; it is unconscious because it is automatic: it happens without thought, as a robot program; It is uncounsious because it began before the infant understood language and hence is non-verbal, innarticulate, and felt rather than understood; and it is unconscious becuase it is all-over-the-body-at-once. Specifically, it is characterised by the Resperatory Block first noted by [[Wilhelm Reich]]; a chronic muscular armouring that prevents proper relaxed breathing. It is known in popular culture as "being uptight". All of the most successfull reimprinting techniques for this kind of chronic anxiety focus on the body first, not the "mind". [[Konrad Lorenz]] aquired his insights on the imprinting process by consciously imitating the body movements of the animals he was studying. Similarly, [[Wilhelm Reich]] found that he could understand the condition of his patients with remarkable clarity by imitating their bodily movements and postures. This is why all schools of yoga‚ÄîBuddhist, Hindu, Sufi‚Äîemphasize restoring natural breathing before they move the student towards the higher circuits of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]]. An example of such a practice within the Buddhist tradition would be the [[mindfulness of breathing]] exersize, in which one "breaths in tranquilizing the body", that is, one puts forth the effort to slow the breath and thus calm the body, and is also done though the development of [[Serenity]].
