## Sombunall  # 

Sombunall is a word coined by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] meaning some-but-not-all. As [[The five stages of the perception process]] have demonstrated, [[perception]] involves involves subtraction and addition‚Äîif we look at, say, an apple, we do not see the apple but only part of the surface of the apple‚Äîand our generalizations or [[Reality tunnel]]s are made up of coordinations or orchestations of these abstractions. Thus we never know "all," but at best, know _sombunall_. 

Now, imagine a world in which German did not contain the word "alles" or any of its derivatives, but did include some form of sombunall. Adolf Hitler would have never been able to say, or even think, most of his generalizations about the Jews. At most he would be talking or thinkning about _sombunall_ Jews. Wilson states that though this may have not prevented the Holocaust, Holocaust mentalities are envouraged by all-ness mentalities and are discouraged by sombunall statements. 

If [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had a form of sombunall instead of all in his vocabulary, he could have still generalized about sombunall women, but not all women; and a major source of literary misogony would have vanished from our culture. Imagine Feminists talking about sombunall men, but not all men. Imagine a debate about UFOs in which both sides could generalize as much as they wanted about sombunall sightings but there was no linguistic form to generalize about all sightings. 

Imagine what would happen with, along with this semantic hygiene, the Aristotelean "is" was replaced with by the neurologically accurate "seems to be." "All  modern music is junk" would become "Sombunall modern music seems like junk to me." Other dogmatic statements would become "Sombunall scientists seem to be to be ignorant of art and culture," "Sombunall artists seem to me to be ignorant of science," "Sombunall English men seem to be a bit pompous," "Sombunall Irish men seem to me to drink a lot." Etc. 

Any [[Idol]]s would suddenly shrink back into models or [[reality tunnel]]s; we would remeber that we created them, or that our ancestors did. We might become startlingly sane.
