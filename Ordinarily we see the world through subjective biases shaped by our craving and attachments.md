## Ordinarily we see the world through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments  #🧠

Ordinarily we see the world through the refractory prism of subjective biases. These biases are shaped by our cravings and attachments, which they in turn reinforce. We see things that we want to see and we blot things out that threaten and disturb us, that shake our complacency, and throw into question the comforting assumtions about ourselves and our lives. To undo this process requires a commitment to truth that is often unsettling but in the end proves liberating and exhilerating. this can be done though the [[The three standpoints]].
