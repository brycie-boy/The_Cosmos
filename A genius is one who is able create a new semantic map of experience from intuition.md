## A genius is one who is able create a new semantic map of experience from intuition  # 

As with earlier circuits, the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] builds all of its conditioning and learning onto a bedrock of hardwired [[imprint]]ing. Thus, many existentially thinkable thoughts are socially unthinkable, because (a) everybody people in a given society have roughly the same semantic [[imprint]], and (b) this is reinforced daily by assumptions that are taken for granted. 

Thus, a _genius_ is one who is able to, by some internal process, break through to the [[The Meta-Programming Circuit]], a minor nuerological mericale loosly called "intuitioh"‚Äîand comes back down to the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] with the capacity to paint a new samantic map of experience. Needless to say, this is generally seen as a profound shock to those still stuck in the older robotic circuits, the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and the [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]], and [[Opposing Ideas which threaten ones status or comfort zone are generally processed as a threat and are disregarded]]. The long list of martyrs to free enquiry, from [[Socrates]] onward, shows how mechanical this neophobia (the fear of new information) really is.
