## The fourth jhana  #🧠 

The fourth of [[The jhanas]], consists of the abandoning of pleasure and pain and includes the purification of mindfullness by equanimity. From the fourth jhana, three lines of development become possible. The first line is the [[The formless attainments]]. The second line is the acquisition of [[Supernormal Powers]]. The third line is the knowledge of the distruction of [[The taints]].
