## A languages structure and grammatical rules can distort how we interpret and percieve reality  # 

In considering that [[language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]], more subtle issues arise when we consider the structure of a system of metaphors interlinked with  the grammatical rules of a language. Philosopher [[Ren√© Descartes]], who tried to doubt everything, or at least says he tried, found that he could not doubt the proposition "i think therefor i am." That was because he lived before the discoveries of 19th century linguists. Philosopher [[Fredrich Neitzsche]], who was trained in that field before becoming a philosopher, noted that Descartes couldn't doubt that proposition because he only knew Indo-European languages. It is an Indo-European linguistic convention that a verb must have a substanative noun before it‚Äîthat an action must be attributed to some allegedly isolated and reified actor. It is this convention that is the reason why we still say "_it_ is raining" even though we no longer believe in Zeus or any other rain god and would be hard put to say what else "_it_" might refer to.

These linguistic structural factors may explain some of the great internal conflicts within philosophy. Prof. [[Hugh Kenner]] wittily argued that if Descartes were to think in a French even more latinate than todays, he would percieve "un pomme grosse et rouge" and conclude that the mind starts with general ideas and then determines paticulars. Whereas [[John Locke]], thinking in english, would percieve an object such as "a big red apple" and deduct that the mind starts from particulars and then assembles general ideas.

It may also explain the innability of even genius to translate a poem from one language to another. In Chinese, the characters translated literally to english would be jade / sun + moon comes over to us. Once we know that sun + moon means among other things brightness, it may be interperted as "the jade is bright" or "the jade shines". And student / sun + moon becomes a suprisingly familiar metaphor "the student is bright". But heart + liver / sun + moon has baffled every translator of [[Confucius]].
