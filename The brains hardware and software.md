## The brains hardware and software  # 

Every computer consists of two aspects, the hardware and the software (software here includes information). The hardware in a solid-state computer is concrete and localized, consisting of the CPU, graphics card, ram, display, keyboard, etc. The software consists of programs that can exist in many  forms, including the tottaly abstract. A program can be "in" the computer in the sense that is being recorded on the CPU or on a disk that is hitched up to a computer. It can also exist on paper, ie. a manual. In these cases, the program is not "in" a computer, but can be put "in" at any time. But a program can be even more tenuous than that, it can exist only in ones mind, that is, if it has never been written down, or has been used once and erased afterwords.

The hardware is more "real" than the software in that you can always locate it in space-time. On the other hand, the software is more "real" than the hardware in the sense that the hardware can be smashed into dust (killed), and the software can still exist, and can "manifest" or "materialize" again in a different computer.

Considering that [[The brain can be seen as an electro-collodial computer]], we all know where the hardware is; it is inside the skull. The software, however, seems to be anywhere and everywhere. For instance, the software "in" the brain also exists outside of it in the form, say, a book read many years ago, as well as anyone or (to some extent) anything that has impacted upon ones mind. 

Of course, if consciousness consisted of nothing but this undifferentiated tapioca of timeless, spaceless software, we would have no individuality. We want to know then, how out of this universal ocean of software, a specific person emerges. [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]].
