## The brains hardware and software  #üß† 

Every computer consists of two aspects, the hardware and the software (software here includes information). The hardware in a solid-state computer is concrete and localized, consisting of the CPU, graphics card, ram, display, keyboard, etc. The software consists of programs that can exist in many forms, including the totally abstract. A program can be "in" the computer in the sense that is being recorded on the CPU. It can also exist on paper, ie. a manual. In these cases, the program is not "in" a computer, but can be put "in" at any time. But a program can be even more tenuous than that, it can exist only in ones mind, that is, if it has never been written down or has been used once and then erased afterwords. The hardware is more "real" than the software in that you can always locate it in space-time. On the other hand, the software is more "real" than the hardware in the sense that the hardware can be smashed into dust (killed), and the software can still exist, and can "manifest" or "materialize" again in a different computer.

Considering that [[The brain can be seen as an electro-collodial computer]], we all know where the hardware is; it is inside the skull. The software, however, seems to be anywhere and everywhere. For instance, the software "in" the brain also exists outside of it in the form of, say, a book read many years ago, as well as anyone or (to some extent) anything that has impacted upon ones own brain. Of course, if consciousness consisted of nothing but this undifferentiated tapioca of timeless, spaceless software, we would have no individuality. We want to know then, how out of this universal ocean of software, a specific person emerges. [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]. Becuase [[The brain can be seen as an electro-collodial computer]], all brains follow the same laws, that is, the programs enter the brain, as electro-chemical bonds, in discrete quantum stages. Each set of programs has four basic parts:

- Genetic imperitives: totally hardwired programs or "instincts"
- Imprints: These are more or less hardwired programs which the brain is genetically designed to accept only at specific points of development. These points in [[ethology]] are known as imprint vulnerability
- Conditioning: These are programs built onto the imprints, they are looser and fairly easy to change with counter conditioning
- Learning: this is even looser and "softer" than conditioning

In general, the primordial imprint can always overule any subsequent learning and conditioning. An imprint is a type of software that has become frozen into hardware, bring impressed on tender neurons as they are peculiarly open and vulnrable. Imprints are non-negotiable aspects of our individuality. Out of the infinite amount of possible programs that can exist as potential software, imprints set the limits, parameters, and perimeters with which all subsequent conditioning occurs. Before the first imprint, consciousness is unconditined, "enlightened", or "formless and void" like the universe at the beginning of Genesis. As soon as the first imprint is made, structure emerges out of the creative void. The growing mind, alas, becomes trapped within this structure, it identifies with the structure, it _becomes_ the structure. Each succesive imprint further complicates the software which programs what we experience as "reality". Conditioning and learning build netwroks into this bedrock of imprinted software. The total structure of this brain circuitry makes up our map of the world. It is what our Thinker thinks, and our Prover mechanically fits all incoming signals to the limitations of this map.
