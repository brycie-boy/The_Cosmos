## Once-returning  # 

The once-returner, one of [[The four phases of enlightenment]], does not erradicate any new fetters. They have eliminated the three fetters that [[Stream-entery]] has destroyed and additionaly attenuates [[The three unwholesome roots]] so that they do not arise often and if they do arise do not become obsessive. As the name implies, the once-returner will come back to this world only one more time and then attain [[Nibbana]].
