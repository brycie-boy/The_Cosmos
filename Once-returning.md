## Once-returning  #🧠 

Once-returning is the second of [[The four stages toward enlightenment]]. This stage does not involve the eradication any new fetters. The once-returner eliminates the three fetters destroyed with the attainment of [[Stream-entry]] and additionaly attenuates [[The three unwholesome roots]] so that they do not arise often and if they do arise do not become obsessive. As the name implies, the once-returner will come back to this world only one more time and then attain [[Nibbana]].
