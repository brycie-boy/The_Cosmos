## The ultimate aim of spiritual practice is complete liberation  # 🧠

A blissful heavenly rebirth is not the final goal of spiritual practice. At best it is only a temporary waystation. All conditioned states of existance within [[samsara]] are transitory, unreliable, and bound up with pain. Thus the ultimate aim of spiritual practice is complete release from [[Samsara]]. What lies beyond [[Samsara]] is the uncondioned state called [[Nibbana]].
