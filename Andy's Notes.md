___

- _Evergreen notes_ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects.

- This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes

___

- In contrast to Evergreen notes, Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have _added up_ to anything

___

- Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts ❗️

- People don’t want to forget an idea or a conversation or a task or quote from a book, so they write it down in Evernote or something. What’s the purpose? Probably: “To make sure I don’t forget." Maybe: “Just writing it down helps me remember.”

- In this conception, notes are a way to Close open loops not to accumulate insight. The “real” work happens outside the notes; the notes are just a reference system which stores information which might help, or a write-once pile of “messy” thoughts

___

- That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking” ❗️

- Lots of people write about solutions to the problem that Note-writing practices are generally ineffective The vast majority of that writing fixates on a myopic, “lifehacking”-type frame, focused on answering questions like: “how should I organize my notes?”, “what kind of journal should I use?”, “how can I make it easy to capture snippets of things I read?”, etc.

- Answers to these questions are unsatisfying because the questions are focused on the wrong thing. The goal is not to take notes—the goal is to think effectively. Better questions are “what practices can help me reliably develop insights over time?”, “how can I shepherd my attention effectively?” etc

___

- Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate ❗️

- Much of the day-to-day thinking involved in creative work is simply lost, like sand castles in the tide. Ephemerality can actually be useful in low-fidelity thought, but it’s simply an accidental property in many cases. We should do our serious thinking in the form of Evergreen notes so that the thinking accumulates.

___

- Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought ❗️

- When looking at someone else’s stroke of genius, you see only the end product. You don’t see how much kindling was burnt before that sudden realization was possible. In part, that’s because even our own epiphanies don’t feel like they emerge as a natural consequence of prior efforts—but they do!

- Leaps of insight depend on having accumulated lots of prior thought on those topics. Sometimes that accumulation happens entirely within our subconscious (our “subconscious back burners,” as May-Li would say), but it’s helpful to design our external cognitive systems such that our day-to-day noodling can accrete

- Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought So where does that thought happen? It could happen in your head, or in a series of fleeting sketches in the pages of your notebook, but Knowledge work should accrete, and those mechanisms are awfully lossy.

- Consider some hypothetical leap of insight you’d like to be able to make. To make that leap, you’ll typically need to evolve many independent, partially-formed ideas simultaneously, until they suddenly converge in a flash of inspiration. If you need to iterate on more than a few pieces at once, you may struggle to keep them all in your head.

___

- Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate ❗️

- It’s important to Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply but instead of just writing about the specific book you’re reading, you can (and should) write your notes such that your reading observations accumulate over time as they interact with each other and with your own ideas

- This is also why we write Evergreen notes so that if we encounter a book which discusses a concept we’ve already written about, we’re pushed to integrate new ideas with our prior conception. Certainly, we normally do this when we read, but we’re limited to our faulty memory of other works which might be related. The externalized note-taking system substantially removes this limitation.

___

- Evergreen notes should be atomic

- It’s best to create notes which are only about one thing—but which, as much as possible, capture the entirety of that thing.

- This way, it’s easier to form connections across topics and contexts. If your notes are too broad, you might not notice when you encounter some new idea about one of the notions contained within, and links to that note will be muddied. If your notes are too fragmented, you’ll also fragment your link network, which may make it harder to see certain connections

___

- These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body.

- If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics

- in both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.

- I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around)

- I often begin by writing a note without knowing what the title will be. The title often emerges from the text as it’s written. When a note suggests a strong title with a clear claim, that’s a good sign that it’s starting to make sense.

___
❗️
- Concept handles, after Alexander [https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/)
- A “concept handle” is a memorable noun phrase representing a complex, often abstract topic. For example: “prisoner’s dilemma,” “Overton window,” “belief in belief,”

- Successful concept handles can really amplify a vague idea which many people sort of understand but can’t point to and talk about. If you give that vague notion a crisp, catchy name, you can unlock a lot of conversation and reflection.

___

- When writing Evergreen notes it’s tempting to write notes like “X is bad” or “Y doesn’t work.” Prefer instead to write note titles which express the property or requirement in a positive sense.

- If you’ve thought them through, negatively-oriented notes usually contain a descriptive theory of why the missing/flawed property is important. By bringing that theory to the foreground, you make it easier to see the claims in a systematic context, which, in turn, makes it easier to build on.

___

- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented

- It’s best to factor Evergreen notes by concept (rather than by author, book, event, project, topic, etc). This way, you discover connections across books and domains as you update and link to the note over time

- The most straightforward way to take notes is to start a new note for each book, each project, or each research topic. Because each note covers many concepts, it can be hard to find what you’ve written when a concept comes up again later: you have to remember the name of each book or project which dealt with the topic

- When you read another book which discusses the same concept, you’ll write a new note on that book. With this approach, there’s no accumulation

- Your new thoughts on the concept don’t combine with the old ones to form a stronger whole: you just have a scattered set of notes on the concept,

- it’s not just about accumulation. There’s also no pressure to synthesize your new ideas on the concept with your prior thoughts about it.

- novel connections tend to appear where they’re not quite so expected. When arranging notes by concept, you may make surprising links between ideas that came up in very different books. You might never have noticed that those books were related before

- Organizing by concept makes note-taking a little harder, but in a useful way: when writing new notes, we have to find where they fit into the whole. So we explore some part of our prior web of notes, which may lead us somewhere unexpected.

___
❗️
- Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies

- Our file systems, organizational structures, and libraries suggest that hierarchical categories are the natural structure of the world. But often items belong in many places. And items relate to other items in very different hierarchical categories.

- Worse, by presorting things into well-specified categories, we necessarily fuzz their edges. Things don’t always fit _exactly_. Maybe once enough new ideas are collected, a new category would emerge… except you can’t see its shape because everything’s already been sorted. And because everything’s already been sorted, further sorting requires undoing existing structure.

- It’s better to let networks of related ideas to gradually emerge, unlabeled:

- once you can see the shape, then you can think about its character.

___
❗️
- Do your own thinking

- Beware: it’s too easy to let others’ schema and ideas dominate your own.

- When reading, the default is to let the author do your thinking for you. Per Schopenhauer: When we read someone else thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … Accordingly in reading we are for the most part absolved of the work of thinking. … It stems from this that whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own as someone who always rides forgets in the end how to walk... But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other people’s thoughts.

- For deep understanding, it’s not enough to just highlight or write marginalia in books: there isn’t much pressure to synthesize, connect, or to get to the heart of things. And they don’t add up to anything over time as you read more. Instead, write Evergreen notes as you read.

___
❗️
- Close open loops

- Tasks left undone, observations left unrecorded, replies yet to be written—these swirl about our minds, as if we’re rehearsing them over and over again to make sure they’re not forgotten. To get rid of this nagging and create a “mind like water” (to use the term in Allen, 2015), build systems to reliably close these open loops.

- For instance: for operational to-dos, this means (Allen, 2015):

1.  You should be able to record a task anywhere
2.  You regularly drain tasks from this list
3.  You regularly delegate, refactor, or delete tasks which you can’t prioritize

- Taken together, these properties ensure that when you record a task, _you can stop thinking about it._ Ubiquitous capture isn’t enough, as most to-do systems demonstrate. If you don’t regularly review your task list and decide to delete or re-strategize lingering tasks, you won’t be able to trust that you’ll follow up on tasks you record.

___
❗️
- Executable strategy for writing

- A naive writing process begins with a rough inkling about what one wants to write and a blank page. Progress from this point requires an enormous amount of activation energy and cognitive effort: there’s nothing external, so you must juggle all of the piece-to-be in your head.

- By contrast, if you’ve already written lots of concept-oriented Evergreen notes around the topic, your task is more like editing than composition. You can make an outline by shuffling the note titles, write notes on any missing material, and edit them together into a narrative.

- In fact, because you can Create speculative outlines while you write you might find that the first of these steps is already accomplished, too. And writing each note isn’t hard: Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing")

- nstead of having a task like “write an outline of the first chapter,” you have a task like “find notes which seem relevant.

___

-  Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)

- Evergreen notes’ atomic size (Evergreen notes should be atomic) and link structures (Evergreen notes should be densely linked) make it easy to stop and resume work. This helps us Close open loops

- These small, self-contained notes represent regular checkpoints. Each note takes only a few minutes to write, but because they’re Evergreen notes, each note is solid ground to stand on—fairly complete relative to its own concept (Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented). Of course, we’ll iterate on their contents over time, but each time we do, that note will remain a mostly-complete, self-contained unit.

- By contrast, when we’re working on a large work-in-progress manuscript, we’re juggling many ideas in various states of completion. Different parts of the document are at different levels of fidelity. The document is large enough that it’s easy to lose one’s place or to forget where other relevant points are when one returns. Starting and stopping work for the day feel like heavy tasks, drawing heavily on working memory.

- Instead of having a task like “write an outline of the first chapter,” you have a task like “find notes which seem relevant.” Each step feels doable. This is an Executable strategy

- I describe two approaches here: an **undirected** version, in which writing projects emerge organically from daily work; and a **directed** version, in which you’re trying to write about something specific.

- Undirected version:
1.  Write durable notes continuously while reading and thinking. ([Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be))
2.  Each time you add a note, add a link to it to an outline, creating one if necessary ([Create speculative outlines while you write](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2uXyfV67dnWLUKg1iDbsrHk3DGjtNWTxSTah)).
3.  Eventually, you’ll feel excited about fleshing out one of those outlines. ([Let ideas and beliefs emerge organically](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5uSCvx3W2GdzBVhWAAXrrCcykJ8SHimdJzg7))
4.  Write new notes to fill in missing pieces of the outline.
5.  Concatenate all the note texts together to get an initial manuscript
6.  Rewrite it.

- Directed version:
1.  Review notes related to your topic (and a step or two beyond those—[Notes should surprise you](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4KZ9973AoHhvM9Pj5Qrds48JXNbMEwVJmVRw))
2.  Write an outline
3.  Attach existing notes to each point in the outline; write new notes as needed.
4.  Concatenate all the note texts together to get an initial manuscript
5.  Rewrite it.

- Ahrens, S. (2017). _How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers_.: As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time. All this enables us to later pick up a task exactly where we stopped without the need to “keep in mind” that there still was something to do. That is one of the main advantages of thinking in writing – everything is externalised anyway. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts.

___

- Executable strategy ❗️

___

- Create speculative outlines while you write ❗️

- When you write a new note, add it to one or more outlines you’re maintaining, creating a new one if necessary. Substantially-complete writing projects will naturally emerge.

- Normally, we start an outline when we start a writing project. This forces us to start with a blank page. By contrast, if we write new notes every day and notice how they relate to each other, these can accumulate into potential writing projects. When an outline feels “ripe,” we can pluck it and turn it into a manuscript without the exerting herculean start-up effort that comes with a blank page.

- Maintaining already-written notes in an outline is comparatively easy: just look at a pair of notes and ask: which comes first? (Pirsig)

- Ahrens, S. (2017). _How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers_.: Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. Steven Johnson, who wrote an insightful book about how people in science and in general come up with genuine new ideas, calls it the “slow hunch.” As a precondition to make use of this intuition, he emphasises the importance of experimental spaces where ideas can freely mingle (Johnson 2011). A laboratory with open-minded colleagues can be such a space, much as intellectuals and artists freely discussed ideas in the cafés of old Paris. I would add the slip-box as such a space in which ideas can mingle freely, so they can give birth to new ones. “When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.” When Luhmann asked what else he did when he was stuck, his answer was: “Well, writing other books. I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.”

___

- Use notes to avoid preconceived conclusions ❗️

- When writing manuscripts, one often begins with a conclusion (or at least an angle) in mind, and then we write or do research with an eye to supporting that idea. If we’re not careful, those preconceptions will distort our thinking. But if we begin by writing Evergreen notes should be atomic, we can let the conclusions and topic _emerge_ from our careful thinking.

- > The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research.

- Ahrens, S. (2017). _How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers_.
- The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. First, you basically fix your present understanding, as the outcome instead of using it as the starting point, priming yourself for one-sided perception. Then you artificially create a conflict of interest between getting things done (finding support for your preconceived argument) and generating insight, turning any departure from your preconceived plan into a mutiny against the success of your own project. This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong.
