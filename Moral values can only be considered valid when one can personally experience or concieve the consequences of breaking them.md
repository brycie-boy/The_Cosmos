## Moral values can only be considered valid when one can personally experience or concieve the consequences of breaking them  # 

Our most existential demand is the need for freedom from, harm, sorrow, and distress. Or expressed more positively, to achieve happiness and well-being. There are many people in the world‚Äîadvertisers, gurus, polititions, etc.‚Äîwho claim to hold a path to true peace and happiness. However, [[many doctrines promote ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them]], and in order to avoid pain and secure our well being, it is not sufficient to merely hope. Although [[The Buddha]]s teaching contains concepts such as the experience of suffering in future lives. We can still use our present experience, backed by intelligent observation, as a criterion for determining what is beneficial and what is detrimental to our current lives. According to [[The Buddha]], whatever arises, arises due to the appropriate causes and conditions. This applies with equal force to suffering and happiness. Thus we must ascertain the causes and conditions that lead to harm and suffering, and likewise the causes and conditions that lead to happiness and well being. 

In his discourse to the Kalamas, [[The Buddha]] begins by proposing that [[no doctrine can be considered true until it has been validated personally]]. So rather than asking us to wrestle with issues that, in our present condition, no amount of experience can decide, he instead askes us to consider a few questions pertaining to our welfare and happiness, questions that we can answer on the basis of our own immidiate experience. Always underlying [[The Buddha]]s questions and the Kalamas replies is a tacit premise that people are primarily motivated to act though a concern for their own welfare. [[The Buddha]]s purpose in asking these questions is to lead the Kalamas to see that, even if we suspend all concern for future lives, [[The three unwholesome roots]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]] eventually rebound to ones own harm and suffering right here and now. Conversley, [[The three wholesome roots]] and [[Wholesome kamma]] lead to ones long term welfare and happiness here and now. Once this much is seen, the immedietly visible consequences of which [[The three unwholesome roots]] and [[Unwholesome kamma]] lead become a suffecient reason for abandoning them. 

Then wether or not there is an afterlife, one has an adequite reason to abandon uwholesome states and cultivate wholesome ones. If there is an afterlife, then ones recompose is that much greater.
