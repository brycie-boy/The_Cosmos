## Conceptual understanding  #🧠 

Conceptual understanding is the correct understanding of the [[Dhamma]] arrived by study and examantion of [[The Buddha]]s teaching in depth. Such understanding is by no means dry and sterile. When rooted in faith of the [[Buddha]]s enlightenment and a strong determination to understand the [[Dhamma]], it serves a a germ for which [[Experiental understanding]] evolves and thus is a critical step in the growth of wisdom.
