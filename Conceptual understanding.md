## Conceptual understanding  # 

Conceptual understanding is the correct understanding of the [[Dhamma]] arrived by study and examantion of [[The Buddha]]s teaching in depth. Such understanding is by no means dry and sterile. When rooted in faith of the [[Buddha]]s enlightenment and a strong determination to understand the [[Dhamma]], it serves a a germ for which [[Experiental understanding]] evolves and thus is a critical step in the growth of wisdom. 

In the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, [[Paññā]] is not bare intuition, but a careful, descrimitive understanding that at certain stages involves precise conceptual operations. [[Paññā]] is directed to specific domains of understanding. These domains, known in the Pali commentaries as "the soil of wisdom", must be thuroughly investigated and understood through conceptual understanding before direct, non conceptual [[Insight]] can effectively accomplish his work. To master them requires analysis, discrimination, and dicernment. One must be able to abstract from the overwhelming mass of facts certain basic patterns fundemental to all experience and use these patterns as templates for contemplation of ones own experience.
