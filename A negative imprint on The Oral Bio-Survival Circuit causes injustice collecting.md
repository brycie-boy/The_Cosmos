## A negative imprint on The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit causes injustice collecting  # 

If the initial imprint of [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is negative‚Äîif the universe and other humans in general are imprinted as dangerous, threatening, and frightening‚Äî[[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]; the Prover will go on through life adjusting all perceptions to fit this map. This is whats known as the "injustice collector" syndrome (in the language of [[Dr. Edmund Bergler]]). The female members of this imprint group end up becoming radical feminists, the male members are less organized and can be found in fringe groups of the extreme left and extreme right.
