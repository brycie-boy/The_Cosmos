## The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit  # 

The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted by the mother figure or object and is conditioned by subsequent nourishment or threat. It is primarily concerned with suckling, feeding, cuddling, and bodily security. It retreats mechanically from the noxious and preditory‚Äîor what is percieved as noxious or preditory. It very simply programs an either-or-choice. GO FORWARD to the nourishing, the protective. GO BACK, away from the threatning, the preditory, thus linking it to [[The three unwholesome roots]] of Buddhism. This bio-survival circuit of consciosness is one demensional.

Any mammal hooks the bio-survival circuit to the first imprinted bio-survival object: the teat. Bio-survival and orality are deeply blended in all mammals. How important is oral imprinting? If  mother isnt present, the closest subsitute within the enviorment will be imprinted. We read of a giraffe who's mother was accidentily killed by a jeep immedietly after its birth. The neonate, follwing hardwired genetic programs, imprinted the object that most closely fit the giraffe archetype‚Äîthe jeep itself. He followed it around, vocalized to it, attempted to suckle from it, and, when an adult, attempted to mate with it. Similarly, [[Konrad Lorenz]] tells of a gosling who accidentily imprinted a ping-pong ball and spent his adult life, in different towards female geese, trying to sexualy mount ping-pong balls.

The "wiring" of this circuit in its primitive form, occured in the first organisms, between three and four billion years ago. In modern humans, this structure remains in [[The brain stem]] and in [[The automatic nervous system]], where it is interconnected with [[The endocrine system]] and other life support systems. This is why disturbances of this circuit act "all over the body at once" and generally take the form of physical symptoms rather than "mental" symptoms and usually get reffered to a doctor instead of the psychaitrist.
