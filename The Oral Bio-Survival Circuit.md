## The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit  #üß† 

The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit, one of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]], is imprinted by the mother figure or object and is conditioned by subsequent nourishment or threat. It is primarily concerned with suckling, feeding, cuddling, and bodily security. It retreats mechanically from the noxious and preditory‚Äîor what is percieved as noxious or preditory (by imprinting or conditioning). It very simply programs an either-or-choice. GO FORWARD to the nourishing, the protective. GO BACK, away from the threatning, the preditory. This circuit is correspondent to the [[The three unwholesome roots]] of Buddhism. Consciousness in this circuit is one dimensional. Any mammal hooks the bio-survival circuit to the first imprinted bio-survival object: the teat. Bio-survival and orality are deeply blended in all mammals. If a mother isnt present, the closest subsitute within the enviorment will be imprinted.

The "wiring" of this circuit occured in the first organisms, between three and four billion years ago. In modern humans, this structure remains in [[The brain stem]] and in [[The automatic nervous system]], where it is interconnected with [[The endocrine system]] and other life support systems. This is why disturbances of this circuit act "all over the body at once" and generally take the form of physical symptoms rather than "mental" symptoms and usually get refered to a doctor instead of a psychaitrist. 

In pre-neurological terms, the oral bio-survival circuit is what we usually call "[[Consciousness]]". It is the sense of being here now, in this vulnerable body, subject to the raw energies and forces of the physical universe. When we are "unconscious", the circuit is turned off and doctors can cut us up without our attempting to flee or cry out.
