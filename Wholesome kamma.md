## Wholesome kamma #🧠  

Wholesome [[kamma]] is kamma that is non-afflictive to the agent, morally commendable, and brings pleasant results. It is [[kamma]] that ripens into good fortune and happiness, or a heavenly experience. The criterion for judging [[kamma]] as wholesome or unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots". There are three wholesome roots:

- generosity
- loving-kindness
- wisdom
