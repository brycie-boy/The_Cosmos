## No doctrine can be considered true until it has been validated personally # 

To deal with the fact that [[many doctrines promote ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them]],  [[the Buddha]] , in his discourse with the Kalamas, recommended that we do not come to conclusions by simply placing faith in doctrines that lie beyond the range of our immediate experience. The Kalamas were a group of people living in the remote area of the Ganges plain. Various religous teachers would come to visit them and each would extol their own doctrines and tear down the doctrines their rivals. Confused by this conflict between belief systems, the Kalamas did not know whom to trust. 

[[The Buddha]] named ten fallible sources of knowledge which should not be immediately viewed as truthful without further investigation. The first four of these pertain to establilshed scriptural authourity: [[Appeal to majority]], [[Appeal to tradition]], appeal to annecdotal evidence, appeal to scriptural authority. The next four pertain to rational grounds: The [[Pure Reason fallacy]], inferintial reasoning, [[Appeal to common sense]], and the [[Mind projection fallacy]]. The final two pertain to authoritive persons: [[Appeal to accomplishment]], and [[Appeal to authority]]. 

It must be stressed that this does not mean that one should reject all external authorities and to fashion our own personal path to truth. Read in context, [[The Buddha]]s message to the Kalamas is quite different. The Buddha is not advising the Kalamas to reject all authoritative guides to knowledge and fall back solely on their personal intuition. Rather, he is offering them a simple and pragmatic outlet from the morass of doubt and perplexity in which they are immersed. By the use of skillful methods of inquiry, he leads them to understand a number of basic principles that they can verify by their own experience and thereby acquire a sure starting point for further intelletual or spiritual development.
