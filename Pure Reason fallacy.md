## Pure Reason fallacy # 

Despite [[The water bowls experiment]], some Greek philosophers still believed there was a path to certitude. They called it the path of Pure Reason. The arguement for Pure Reason goes that, even if sense data is fallible, there exists a higher faculty which is not fallible and knowns turhths a priori. This view has collapsed over the centuries for a variety of reasons, but chiefly becuase the things philosophers thought they knew in this way have often turned out to be simply not true. For instance, philospher [[Immanuel Kant]] still believed that Pure Reason "knew" intuitivley that [[Euclidean Geometry]] was the true and only geometry. Nowadays, mathemeticians have developed a variety of [[Non-Euclidean Geometry]], all of which are equaliy valid and all of which are as useful as [[Euclidean Geometry]] depending on the context.
