## Identity view  #🧠 

Giving up our cravings is so difficult because craving is reinforced by views. [[We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]]. Such views rationalize our cravings and give them a protective sheild.  The type of view that lies at the bottom of all affirmation of selfhood is identity view. [[The Nikayas]] often mention twenty types of identity view, obtained by considering oneself to stand in relation to each of [[The five aggregates]]: either as being identical with it, as possesing it, as containing it, or as being contained within it. Adopting any of these views is the source of all anxiety and distress. It is also the leash that keeps us bound to [[Samsara]]. It is through [[insight]] into [[The three characteristics]] that ones sees the true nature of [[The five aggregates]] and no longer regards them as self or the belongings of a self.
