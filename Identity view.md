## Identity view  # 

Because [[The five aggregates]] are the objective domain of clinging, they are commonly called the five aggregates subject to clinging. One either grasps them and takes possesion of them, that is, one appropriates them; or one uses them as the basis for views about oneself or for conceit ("I am better than, as good as, inferior to others") that is, one identifies with them. As [[The Nikayas]] put it, we are prone to think of [[The five aggregates]] thus: "this is mine, this i am, this is myself." The notion "this is mine" represents an act of appropriation, a function of craving. The notion "this i am" and "this is myself" represent two types of identification: the former expressing conceit, the latter expressing views.
