## Identity view  # 

Because [[The five aggregates]] are the objective domain of clinging, they are commonly called the five aggregates subject to clinging. One either grasps them and takes possesion of them, that is, one appropriates them; or one uses them as the basis for views about oneself or for conceit ("I am better than, as good as, inferior to others") that is, one identifies with them. As [[The Nikayas]] put it, we are prone to think of [[The five aggregates]] thus: "this is mine, this i am, this is myself." The notion "this is mine" represents an act of appropriation, a function of craving. The notion "this i am" and "this is myself" represent two types of identification: the former expressing conceit, the latter expressing views.

Giving up our cravings is so difficult because craving is reinforced by views. [[Ordinarily we see the world through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]]. Such views rationalize our cravings and give them a protective sheild. The type of view that lies at the bottom of all affirmation of selfhood is identity view. The suttas often mention twenty types of identity view, obtained by considering oneself to stand in relation to each of [[The five aggregates]]: either as being identical with it, as possesing it, as containing it, or as being contained within it. Adopting any of these views is the source of all anxiety and distress. It is also the leash that keeps us bound to [[Samsara]]. It is through [[insight]] into [[The three characteristics]] that one sees the true nature of [[The five aggregates]] and no longer regards them as self or the belongings of a self.
