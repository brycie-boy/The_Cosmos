## The Eight Circuits of Consciousness  # 

Following [[Dr. Timothy Leary]], we shall divide [[The brains hardware and software]] into eight "circuits". The first four circuits are "antique" or conservative. They exist in everybody. These are:

- [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]]
- [[The Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]]
- [[The Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]]
- [[The Moral Socio-Sexual Circuit]]

The development of these circuits as the brain evolved through evolution, and as each domesticated primate (human) recapitulates evolution in growing from infancy to adulthood, makes possible gene-pool survival, mammilian sociobiology (pecking order or politics), and transmition of culture.

The second group of circuits is much newer, and exists at present only in minorities. Where as the antique circuits recapictualate evolution to the present, these futuristic circuits precapitulate our future evolution. These include:

- [[The Holistic Neurosomantic Circuit]]
- [[The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit]]
- [[The Meta-Programming Circuit]]
- [[The Non-Local Quantum Circuit]]
