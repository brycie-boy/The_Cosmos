## The Bio-Survival circuit acts entirely unconciously and automatically # 

[[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] is the oldest circuit of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]] in evolutionary development. Thus, it is the most mechanical and rapid. One is not conscious of time at all on the bio-survival circuit. The hardwired programs act automatically (unconsciously) because if you had to stop and think out every situation, you would be eaten by the first predator. 

Of course, the imprint is made by chance‚Äîby the circumstances one is born under. Some imprint bravery, inquisitiveness, and exploratory drive; others imprint timidity, infophobia (fear of the unpredictable), and withdrawl. All of which is robotic until one learns how to reprogram and reimprint ones mind. [[The most successful reimprinting techniques focus on the body first rather than the mind]].
