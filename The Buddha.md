### Per Wiki:

> Gautama Buddha (also Siddhattha Gotama; Sakkamuni and The Buddha) was an ascetic and spiritual teacher of South Asia who lived during the latter half of the first millennium BCE. He was the founder of Buddhism and is revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being whose teachings sought a path to freedom from ignorance (of [[The four nobel truths]]), craving, rebirth and dissatisfaction. Born in Lumbini (present day Nepal) in the clan of the Shakya, he spent the majority of his adult life in modern day Nepal and India, attaining enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya. He preached his first sermon on [[The four nobel truths]] in Sarnath, where the Buddhist sangha also came to life. The Buddha has since been venerated by numerous religions and communities across Asia.
