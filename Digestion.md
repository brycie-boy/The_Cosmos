### The Note Making Process
If my system is called The Cosmos, then, of course, it’s makes sense to liken my notes to the birth of a star. Each idea in my head is a star in the universe that is my mind. 

The process consists of 6 stages, as shown below.


##### 1. ☁️ Stellar Nursery

“And the earth was void without form”

The Stellar Nursery is where my inbox notes are stored. All of the annotations from a source go into an  inbox note. The annotations within an inbox note are very atomized; They’re scattered and unrelated. This is the gaseous stage of a note. Within an inbox note, annotations are brought together into cohesive clusters. 

##### 2. ⛅️ Proto

The chaos of the Stellar Nursery is beginning to condense. The dust is beginning to clear, and idea is beginning to emerge from the clouds, but it’s still veiled in ambiguity.

##### 3. ☀️ Main-Sequence

“Then god said let there be be light, and it was so!”

The dust has now been completely cleared and condensed into an clear, distinct, cohesive thought. The growing pains are over and the note is ina stable state. The note has now entered the main sequence stafe and has evolved into a fully matured star. Capable of spreading its light across The Cosmos. Main-sequence notes are densely interconnected, fully fleshed out, permanently useful, distinct ideas.

##### 4. ✨ Constellations

Each note is given tags. Overtime, these tags accumulate notes. Once a tag grows enough, it gets turned into its own note, which I call constellations. Each constellation contains links to each note containing the tag. Constellations provide a map for a subject, sort of like a table of contents, allowing for easier navigation.

##### 5. 🫀 The Core

The Core is the heart of The Cosmos. Constellations are stored in the Core. The Core gives a birds eye view of The Cosmos, and provides a diving point into what ever section of the Cosmos you want to explore.
