### The Note Making Process
If my system is called The Cosmos, then, of course, it’s makes sense to compare my notes to the birth of a star. Each idea in my head is a star in the universe that is my mind. 

The process consists of 6 stages, as shown below.


##### 1. ☁️ Stellar Nursery

- Supernova
	- ideas of others explode into the Cosmos
- Nebula
	- when the note process is complete

“And the earth was void without form”

The Stellar Nursery is where my inbox notes are stored. Or what I call nebulas. All of the annotations I collect from a source have are put into there own nebula. 

The Stellar Nursery has 2 stages:

- **💥 Supernova**
	This is the ideas of others burst into my my universe. This starts out as a inbox scrap note, which is just a straight up annotation export. This is the most scattered and chaotic stage of the 

- **☁️ Nebula**
	When a nebula has done its job and has created new stars, it is considered complete and is labeled with the appropriate symbol

The annotations within an inbox note are very atomized; They’re scattered, bouncing around, and colliding, so this is considered the gaseous stage of a note. 

##### 2. ⛅️ Proto

The chaos of the Stellar Nursery is beginning to condense. The dust is beginning to clear, and idea is beginning to emerge from the clouds, but it’s still veiled in ambiguity.

Liquid stage

##### 3. ☀️ Main-Sequence

“Then god said let there be be light, and it was so!”

The dust has now been completely cleared and condensed into an clear, distinct, cohesive thought. The growing pains are over and the note is ina stable state. The note has now entered the main sequence stafe and has evolved into a fully matured star. Capable of spreading its light across The Cosmos. Main-sequence notes are densely interconnected, fully fleshed out, permanently useful, distinct ideas.

Solid stage

##### 4. ✨ Constellations

Each note is given tags. Overtime, these tags accumulate notes and create a structure. Once a tag grows enough, it gets turned into its own note, which I call constellations. Each constellation contains links to each note containing the tag. Constellations provide a map for a subject, sort of like a table of contents, allowing for easier navigation.

##### 5. 🫀 The Core

The Core is the highest order note. It is the heart of The Cosmos. Constellations are stored within the Core note. The Core gives a birds eye view of The Cosmos, and provides a diving point into what ever section of the Cosmos you want to explore.
