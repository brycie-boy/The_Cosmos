### The Note Making Process
If my system is called The Cosmos, then, of course, it’s makes sense to compare my notes to the birth of a star. Each idea in my head is a star in the universe that is my mind. 

The process consists of 6 stages, as shown below.


##### 1. ☁️ The Stellar Nursery

“And the earth was void without form”

The Stellar Nursery is where my inbox notes are stored. Or what I call nebulas. All of the annotations I collect from a source have are put into there own nebula. 

The Stellar Nursery has 2 stages:

- **💥 Supernova**
	This is what i call my incomplete inbox notes. The name represents the ideas of others bursting into my my universe. This is the most scattered and chaotic stage of the 

- **☁️ Nebula**
	When the chaos subsides, and gravity has condensed all the annotations into fully formed stars, then the inbox note process is complete and is given certified nebula status and recieves the appropriate emoji seen above.

Considering that the annotations within an inbox note are very atomized, scattered, bouncing around, and colliding, this stage is considered the gaseous stage of a the note process. 

##### 2. ⛅️ Proto Note

The chaos of the Stellar Nursery is beginning to condense. The dust is beginning to clear, and idea is beginning to emerge from the clouds, but it’s still veiled in ambiguity.

Liquid stage

##### 3. ☀️ Main-Sequence Note

“Then god said let there be be light, and it was so!”

The dust has now been completely cleared and condensed into an clear, distinct, cohesive thought. The growing pains are over and the note is ina stable state. The note has now entered the main sequence stafe and has evolved into a fully matured star. Capable of spreading its light across The Cosmos. Main-sequence notes are densely interconnected, fully fleshed out, permanently useful, distinct ideas.

Solid stage

##### 4. ✨ Constellations

Each note is given tags. Overtime, these tags accumulate notes and create a structure. Once a tag grows enough, it gets turned into its own note, which I call constellations. Each constellation contains links to each note containing the tag. Constellations provide a map for a subject, sort of like a table of contents, allowing for easier navigation.

##### 5. 🫀 The Core Note

The Core is the highest order note. It is the heart of The Cosmos. Constellations are stored within the Core note. The Core gives a birds eye view of The Cosmos, and provides a diving point into what ever section of the Cosmos you want to explore.
