## Hallucinations are rooted in deceptive habitual programs of perception within the brain  # 

Although many people traditionally view the internal [[six sense bases]] as passive receptors of objective phenomena, the study of illusions and ambiguous images has demonstated that the process of [[perception]] is not passive reaction but creative [[transaction]] and that [[The external world that we percieve is a only the product of what the brain receives, edits, and classifies]]. For instance, take the famous Muller-Lyer Illusion as an example. The illusion consists of two parellel lines, the one on top accompanied with two arrows on each side while the one one the bottom is accompanied with two inverse arrows on its sides.

The line on the bottom is generally percieved as being longer than the one on top despite the two lines being of the same lengths. This is because the brain is working on deceptive habitual programs of [[perception]]. The arrow and reverse arrow decorations seduce the eye-brain system into seeing innacuratley. This experience is a demonstration of mild hallucination.

The author [[Robert Anton Wilson]] proposes that the process by which "miracles" or "UFOs" are created and by which we "create" the chair across the room, are fundementally similar. For those who believe the chair is somehow more "objective" than a poem, an art piece, this diagram, etc. Wilson offers an experiment. It involves hiring three painters and three photographers to make a  "realistic portrait" of the chair, in which one finds that when looking at these portriaits, a personality has somehow given meaning or richness to the portayed image.
