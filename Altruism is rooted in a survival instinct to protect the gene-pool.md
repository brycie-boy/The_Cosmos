## Altruism is rooted in a survival instinct to protect the gene-pool #üß† 

On top of the hardwired imprinting of [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] comes "softer" conditioning. This allows the safe-space perimeter to be generalized outward from the mother's body to the pack or tribe‚Äîthe "extended family". Every social animal has, in addition to the instict (genetic program) of self-preservation, a similar instinct to protect the gene-pool. This instinct is the basis for altruism, and social animals could not survive without it. Whereas the instinct of self-preservation can be represented by [[The three unwholesome roots]], the characteristics of this altruistic instinct, in contrast, can be represented by [[The three wholesome roots]].
