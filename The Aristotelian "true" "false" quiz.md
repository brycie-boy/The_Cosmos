## The Aristotelian "true" "false" quiz  # 

To demonstate how [[we ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]], [[Robert Anton Wilson]] provides a list of 21 propositions and asks us to try and answer them in a strictly Aristotelian "true" / "false" manner without deciding upon any "maybes". These propositions include: 

1. Water boils at 100 Degrees Celsius.
2. pq equals qp.
3. The infamous Dr. Crippen poisened his wife.
4. The Communists are plotting to enslave us.
5. The Nazi's killed 6,000,000 Jews.
6. Marylin Manroe was the most beautiful woman of her time. 
7. There is a tenth planet in our solar system, beyond pluto.
8. Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
9. Francis Bacon wrote Hamlet. 
10. Lady Chatterley's Lover is a pornographic novel. 
11. Lady Chatterley's Lover is a sexist novel. 
12. The Pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals.
13. Beethoven is a better composer than Motzart.
14. Ronald Regan wrote Hamlet.
15. God has spoken to me.
16. The following sentence is false.
17. The previous sentence is true. 
18. All human beings are created equal. 
19. Capitalism is doomed by its internal contradictions.
20. My spouse has been faithful to me. 
21. I am probably not as smart as i think i am

He then asks us to try and notice the instances in which emotional prefrences and fixed ideas are perceptible, esspecially when the evidence for one of the questions is dubious or controversial.
