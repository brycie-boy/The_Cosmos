## The three characteristics  # 

[[The three unwholesome roots]] and their offshoots ultimatley stem from ignorance, thus ignorance lies at the bottom of all suffering and bondage. Ignorance weaves a net of three delusions around [[the five aggregates]]. These delusions are the notions that the aggregates are static, a source of true satisfaction, and a self. The wisdom need to break the spell of these delusions is [[Insight]] into [[The five aggregates]] as transient, unsatisfactory, and nonself. This is called direct knowledge of the three characteristics of existance.
