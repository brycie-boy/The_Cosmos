## The three characteristics  # 

[[The three unwholesome roots]] and their offshoots ultimatley stem from ignorance, thus ignorance lies at the bottom of all suffering and bondage. Ignorance weaves a net of three delusions around [[the five aggregates]]. These delusions are the notions that the aggregates are static, a source of true satisfaction, and a self. The wisdom need to break the spell of these delusions is [[Insight]] into [[The five aggregates]] as transient, unsatisfactory, and nonself. This is called direct knowledge of the three characteristics of existance.

Some suttas seem to make [[insight]] into one of the three characteristics sufficient enough for realizing [[nibbana]]. However, the three characteristics are closley interwoven and thus the most common formula in [[The Nikayas]] usually builds upon there internal relationship. The characteristic of transience reveals the charateristic of unsatisfactoriness, and both together reveal the characteristic of nonself. First, [[The five aggregates]] are nonself on the grounds that we cannot detetmine them and therefor do not have complete mastery over them. Since we cannot bend the aggregates to our will, they are unsatisfactory, subject to affliction, and therefor cannot be considered our self. Second, whatever is transient is in some way unsatisfactory, and what is transient and unsatisfacory cannot be identified as our self. The suttas seem to take this inderect route to the characteristic of nonself because the selfless nature of things is so subtle that it often cannot be seen except when pointed out by the other two characteristics. Once we recognize that the things we identify as our self are transient and unsatisfactory, we realize that they lack the essential marks of selfhood and we therefor stop identifying with them. 

The different expositions on the three chatacteristics all thus converge on the irradication of clinging. They do so by showing, with regard to each of [[The five aggregates]], "this is not mine, this i am not, this is not myself" ([[Identity view]]). This makes [[insight]] into nonself as the culmanation and consomation of the contemplation of the three characteristics. [[Insight]] into [[The five aggregates]] through the three characteristics leads to disenchantment, dispassion, and liberation. One who attains liberation subsequentluy wins "the knowledge and vision of liberation", the assurance that one is free from [[The taints]], rebirth in [[Samsara]] has ended, and nothing more remains to be done.
