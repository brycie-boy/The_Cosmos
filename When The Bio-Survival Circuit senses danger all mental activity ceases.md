##  When The Bio-Survival Circuit senses danger all mental activity ceases  #üß† 

Throughout human life, when [[The Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] senses danger, all other circuits of [[The Eight Circuits of Consciousness]] are shut down until the bio-survival problem is "solved" realilstically or symbolically. This is of crucial importance for [[Mind-washing]] and [[Brain programming]]. To create a new imprint, first reduce the subject to a state of infancy, or bio-survival vulnerability.
