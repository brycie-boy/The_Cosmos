andys notes inbox scrap

- _Evergreen notes_ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects.

- This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes

- In contrast to Evergreen notes, Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have _added up_ to anything

- Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts

- People don’t want to forget an idea or a conversation or a task or quote from a book, so they write it down in Evernote or something. What’s the purpose? Probably: “To make sure I don’t forget." Maybe: “Just writing it down helps me remember.”

- In this conception, notes are a way to Close open loops not to accumulate insight. The “real” work happens outside the notes; the notes are just a reference system which stores information which might help, or a write-once pile of “messy” thoughts

- That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”

- Lots of people write about solutions to the problem that Note-writing practices are generally ineffective The vast majority of that writing fixates on a myopic, “lifehacking”-type frame, focused on answering questions like: “how should I organize my notes?”, “what kind of journal should I use?”, “how can I make it easy to capture snippets of things I read?”, etc.

- Answers to these questions are unsatisfying because the questions are focused on the wrong thing. The goal is not to take notes—the goal is to think effectively. Better questions are “what practices can help me reliably develop insights over time?”, “how can I shepherd my attention effectively?” etc

- Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work

- if you had to set one metric to use as a leading indicator for yourself as a knowledge worker, the best I know might be the number of Evergreen notes written per day.

- Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate

- Much of the day-to-day thinking involved in creative work is simply lost, like sand castles in the tide. Ephemerality can actually be useful in low-fidelity thought, but it’s simply an accidental property in many cases. We should do our serious thinking in the form of Evergreen notes so that the thinking accumulates.

- Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought

- When looking at someone else’s stroke of genius, you see only the end product. You don’t see how much kindling was burnt before that sudden realization was possible. In part, that’s because even our own epiphanies don’t feel like they emerge as a natural consequence of prior efforts—but they do!

- Leaps of insight depend on having accumulated lots of prior thought on those topics. Sometimes that accumulation happens entirely within our subconscious (our “subconscious back burners,” as May-Li would say), but it’s helpful to design our external cognitive systems such that our day-to-day noodling can accrete

- Leaps of insight emerge from prior thought So where does that thought happen? It could happen in your head, or in a series of fleeting sketches in the pages of your notebook, but Knowledge work should accrete, and those mechanisms are awfully lossy.

- Consider some hypothetical leap of insight you’d like to be able to make. To make that leap, you’ll typically need to evolve many independent, partially-formed ideas simultaneously, until they suddenly converge in a flash of inspiration. If you need to iterate on more than a few pieces at once, you may struggle to keep them all in your head.

- Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate

- It’s important to Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply but instead of just writing about the specific book you’re reading, you can (and should) write your notes such that your reading observations accumulate over time as they interact with each other and with your own ideas

- This is also why we write Evergreen notes so that if we encounter a book which discusses a concept we’ve already written about, we’re pushed to integrate new ideas with our prior conception. Certainly, we normally do this when we read, but we’re limited to our faulty memory of other works which might be related. The externalized note-taking system substantially removes this limitation.

- Evergreen notes should be atomic

- It’s best to create notes which are only about one thing—but which, as much as possible, capture the entirety of that thing.

- This way, it’s easier to form connections across topics and contexts. If your notes are too broad, you might not notice when you encounter some new idea about one of the notions contained within, and links to that note will be muddied. If your notes are too fragmented, you’ll also fragment your link network, which may make it harder to see certain connections

- When Evergreen notes are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle

- These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body.

- If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics

- in both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.

- I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around)

- I often begin by writing a note without knowing what the title will be. The title often emerges from the text as it’s written. When a note suggests a strong title with a clear claim, that’s a good sign that it’s starting to make sense.

- Concept handles, after Alexander [https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/)
- A “concept handle” is a memorable noun phrase representing a complex, often abstract topic. For example: “prisoner’s dilemma,” “Overton window,” “belief in belief,”

- Successful concept handles can really amplify a vague idea which many people sort of understand but can’t point to and talk about. If you give that vague notion a crisp, catchy name, you can unlock a lot of conversation and reflection.

- When writing Evergreen notes it’s tempting to write notes like “X is bad” or “Y doesn’t work.” Prefer instead to write note titles which express the property or requirement in a positive sense.

- If you’ve thought them through, negatively-oriented notes usually contain a descriptive theory of why the missing/flawed property is important. By bringing that theory to the foreground, you make it easier to see the claims in a systematic context, which, in turn, makes it easier to build on.

- Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented

- It’s best to factor Evergreen notes by concept (rather than by author, book, event, project, topic, etc). This way, you discover connections across books and domains as you update and link to the note over time

- When you read another book which discusses the same concept, you’ll write a new note on that book. With this approach, there’s no accumulation

- The most straightforward way to take notes is to start a new note for each book, each project, or each research topic. Because each note covers many concepts, it can be hard to find what you’ve written when a concept comes up again later: you have to remember the name of each book or project which dealt with the topic

- Your new thoughts on the concept don’t combine with the old ones to form a stronger whole: you just have a scattered set of notes on the concept,

- it’s not just about accumulation. There’s also no pressure to synthesize your new ideas on the concept with your prior thoughts about it.

- novel connections tend to appear where they’re not quite so expected. When arranging notes by concept, you may make surprising links between ideas that came up in very different books. You might never have noticed that those books were related before

- Organizing by concept makes note-taking a little harder, but in a useful way: when writing new notes, we have to find where they fit into the whole. So we explore some part of our prior web of notes, which may lead us somewhere unexpected.

- Evergreen notes should be densely linked

- If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we’re thinking about. It creates pressure to think carefully about how ideas relate to each other

- Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies

- Our file systems, organizational structures, and libraries suggest that hierarchical categories are the natural structure of the world. But often items belong in many places. And items relate to other items in very different hierarchical categories.

- Worse, by presorting things into well-specified categories, we necessarily fuzz their edges. Things don’t always fit _exactly_. Maybe once enough new ideas are collected, a new category would emerge… except you can’t see its shape because everything’s already been sorted. And because everything’s already been sorted, further sorting requires undoing existing structure.

- It’s better to let networks of related ideas to gradually emerge, unlabeled:

- once you can see the shape, then you can think about its character.

- Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply

- If you want to deeply internalize something you’re reading, the best way I know is to write about it:

- because Understanding requires effortful engagement

- If you want to really understand an idea, you have to grapple with it.

- You can’t just read something, listen to a lecture, or hear a notion in a conversation. You’ve got to wonder: where does this apply and where does it not? What are the implications? What are the assumptions? Whose view is represented here? What does this refute? etc.

- and in particular, Writing forces sharper understanding

- Writing is a great way to put pressure on your thinking: it’s hard to summarize something you don’t sharply understand. By trying to explain an idea, you’ll naturally try multiple framings, flesh out its edges, and see new connections

- Accumulating tabs, saving PDFs, and making bookmarks feels like progress, but we systematically overrate its value. Understanding requires effortful engagement you are not likely to draw much understanding from a folder of barely-skimmed PDFs.

- We collect material because it’s easy, and because it quells the anxiety that we’ll never find what we’re looking at again. But really, we’re often just making things worse, burying important materials in tons of secondary matter we just “don’t want to lose

- And to help steer ourselves effectively we should process collected materials in short iteration cycles, rather than letting them pile up for long periods.

- Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate

- It’s important to Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply but instead of just writing about the specific book you’re reading, you can (and should) write your notes such that your reading observations accumulate over time as they interact with each other and with your own ideas

- This is also why we write Evergreen notes so that if we encounter a book which discusses a concept we’ve already written about, we’re pushed to integrate new ideas with our prior conception. Certainly, we normally do this when we read, but we’re limited to our faulty memory of other works which might be related. The externalized note-taking system substantially removes this limitation.

- This is why part of why Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented so that the structure of our notes pushes us to notice the relationships between the ideas in different texts

- Do your own thinking

- Beware: it’s too easy to let others’ schema and ideas dominate your own.

- When reading, the default is to let the author do your thinking for you. Per Schopenhauer: When we read someone else thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … Accordingly in reading we are for the most part absolved of the work of thinking. … It stems from this that whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own as someone who always rides forgets in the end how to walk... But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other people’s thoughts.

- For deep understanding, it’s not enough to just highlight or write marginalia in books: there isn’t much pressure to synthesize, connect, or to get to the heart of things. And they don’t add up to anything over time as you read more. Instead, write Evergreen notes as you read.

- Close open loops

- Tasks left undone, observations left unrecorded, replies yet to be written—these swirl about our minds, as if we’re rehearsing them over and over again to make sure they’re not forgotten. To get rid of this nagging and create a “mind like water” (to use the term in Allen, 2015), build systems to reliably close these open loops.

- For instance: for operational to-dos, this means (Allen, 2015):

1.  You should be able to record a task anywhere
2.  You regularly drain tasks from this list
3.  You regularly delegate, refactor, or delete tasks which you can’t prioritize

- Taken together, these properties ensure that when you record a task, _you can stop thinking about it._ Ubiquitous capture isn’t enough, as most to-do systems demonstrate. If you don’t regularly review your task list and decide to delete or re-strategize lingering tasks, you won’t be able to trust that you’ll follow up on tasks you record.

- A writing inbox for transient and incomplete notes

- Even if you aspire to write Evergreen notes  most notes begin as transient notes. You should be able to capture thoughts without friction then reliably develop them into evergreen notes over time

- a quick way to capture transient notes which clearly isolates them from evergreen notes

- a place to put notes you want to develop further and a practice which reliably drains it

- Executable strategy for writing

- A naive writing process begins with a rough inkling about what one wants to write and a blank page. Progress from this point requires an enormous amount of activation energy and cognitive effort: there’s nothing external, so you must juggle all of the piece-to-be in your head.

- By contrast, if you’ve already written lots of concept-oriented Evergreen notes around the topic, your task is more like editing than composition. You can make an outline by shuffling the note titles, write notes on any missing material, and edit them together into a narrative.

- nstead of having a task like “write an outline of the first chapter,” you have a task like “find notes which seem relevant.

- Create speculative outlines while you write

- When you write a new note, add it to one or more outlines you’re maintaining, creating a new one if necessary. Substantially-complete writing projects will naturally emerge.

- Normally, we start an outline when we start a writing project. This forces us to start with a blank page. By contrast, if we write new notes every day and notice how they relate to each other, these can accumulate into potential writing projects. When an outline feels “ripe,” we can pluck it and turn it into a manuscript without the exerting herculean start-up effort that comes with a blank page.

- Maintaining already-written notes in an outline is comparatively easy: just look at a pair of notes and ask: which comes first? (Pirsig)
