By the New Inquisition I mean to designate certain habits of repression and intimidation that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the scientific community today.

By New Idol I mean to designate the rigid beliefs that form the ideological superstructure of the New Inquisition.

By the New Agnosticism I mean to designate an attitude of mind which has elsewhere been called "model agnosticism" and which applies the agnostic principle not just to the "God" concept but to ideas of all sorts in all areas of thoughts and ideology.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 10 ¬∑ Location 122
The agnostic principle refuses total belief or total denial and regards models as tools to be used only and always where appropriate and replaced (by other models) only and always where not appropriate. It does not regard any models, or any class of models, as more "profound" than any other models, or any class of models but asks only how a model serves, or fails to serve, those who use it. The agnostic principle is intended here in a broad "humanistic" or "existential" sense, and is not intended to be narrowly technical or philosophical only.

Some terms which may be unfamiliar to certain readers are used frequently in this book. They are defined briefly here, and will be explained further, by context and example, as the argument unfolds.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 ¬∑ Location 139
EMIC REALITY: the unified field made up of thoughts, feelings and apparent sense impressions that organizes our inchoate experience into meaningful patterns; the paradigm or model that people create by talking to each other, or by communicating in any symbolism; the culture of a time and place; the semantic environment. Every emic reality has its own structure, which imposes structure upon raw experience.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 ¬∑ Location 143
ETIC REALITY: the hypothetical actuality that has not been filtered through the emic reality of a human nervous system or linguistic grid.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 ¬∑ Location 146 
INFORMATION: as used in mathematical information theory, this denotes the amount of unpredictability in a message; information is, roughly, what you do not expect to hear. In this sense, information may be "true" or "false," but is always a small surprise. Resistance to new information measures the degree of Fundamentalism in a culture, a sub-culture, or an individual.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 ¬∑ Location 151
NEUROSEMANTICS: the study of how symbolism influences the human nervous system; how the local reality-tunnel programs our thoughts, feelings and apparent sense impressions.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 ¬∑ Location 153
REALITY-LABYRINTH: existence regarded as a multiple-choice intelligence test; the sum total of reality-tunnels available to an open-minded or non-Fundamentalistic human at a given time and place.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 ¬∑ Location 155
REALITY-TUNNEL: An emic reality established by a system of coding, or a structure of metaphors, and transmitted by language, art, mathematics or other symbolism.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 12 ¬∑ Location 157
SYNERGY: those behaviors of whole systems which cannot be predicted by analysis of parts or sub-systems. A term popularized by Buckminster Fuller and roughly equivalent to Holism. Cf. Gestalt in psychology and transaction immediately following:

- Highlight(pink) - Page 12 ¬∑ Location 160
TRANSACTION: used here in the sense of Transactional Psychology, which holds that perception is not passive re-action but active, creative trans-action, and that the "observer" and the "observed" must be considered a synergetic whole.

The late R. Buckminster Fuller‚Äîarchitect, engineer, poet, mathematician and gadfly‚Äîused to astonish audiences by remarking casually in the middle of a lecture that everything we see is inside our heads. If the consternation of the audience was voluble. Fuller would stop and explain, by drawing on the blackboard the diagram encountered in the elementary optics part of any first year physics course:

Back in the Renaissance, Francis Bacon, the father of empirical reasoning, announced that materialist science would allow man to ‚Äútake nature by the forelock, hold her down, and submit her to our will.‚Äù He used a rape metaphor to describe the benefits of rational thinking. This is not a way of understanding nature, but forcing nature to conform to the model. As Korzybski and Wilson both liked to remind us, ‚Äúthe map is not the territory.‚Äù For Bacon, this means changing the territory to become more like the map.

Indeed, fundamentalist materialist science is about quantifying everything. If you can‚Äôt measure something and assign a metric, it may as well not exist. Homeopathic medicine, human rapport, and the humanities themselves would fall into this category. Their benefits, even their very existence, cannot be acknowledged because there‚Äôs no instrument capable of quantifying them. That was bad enough.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 8 ¬∑ Location 95
But in a digital age‚Äìand I‚Äôm convinced this is why Bob was interested in my own work‚Äìeverything must be quantized. Things must not only be measurable, but they must be resolved to the nearest appropriate integer. Reality, auto-tuned to the nearest quantized gradient. Not only is the map the territory, but the map is now divided into discrete units. You can be at 49 latitude, or 50 latitude, but nowhere in-between. One or zero. Yes or No. Right or wrong.

Reality is weirder than this. All you need to do is walk in nature, have sex, talk to a cat, or watch a David Lynch movie to understand there is more going on here than can be described by the standardized metrics of science or the sampling rates of digital recording devices. There‚Äôs information between the lines and off the map. Things happen that violate the laws, challenge our long-held assumptions, and suggest that reality is not what it seems.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 8 ¬∑ Location 103
Bob‚Äôs message is more important right now than it was when he wrote it. Our digital fundamentalists see human beings as an engineering problem to be solved. Behaviors and thoughts that do not conform to our algorithmically generated profiles are to be eliminated, and humans shepherded into the reality tunnels that obey the laws of rationality alone.
