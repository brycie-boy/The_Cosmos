By the New Inquisition I mean to designate certain habits of repression and intimidation that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the scientific community today.

- Highlight - Page 10 
By New Idol I mean to designate the rigid beliefs that form the ideological superstructure of the New Inquisition.

- Highlight - Page 10
By the New Agnosticism I mean to designate an attitude of mind which has elsewhere been called "model agnosticism" and which applies the agnostic principle not just to the "God" concept but to ideas of all sorts in all areas of thoughts and ideology.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 10 · Location 122
The agnostic principle refuses total belief or total denial and regards models as tools to be used only and always where appropriate and replaced (by other models) only and always where not appropriate. It does not regard any models, or any class of models, as more "profound" than any other models, or any class of models but asks only how a model serves, or fails to serve, those who use it. The agnostic principle is intended here in a broad "humanistic" or "existential" sense, and is not intended to be narrowly technical or philosophical only.

Some terms which may be unfamiliar to certain readers are used frequently in this book. They are defined briefly here, and will be explained further, by context and example, as the argument unfolds.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 · Location 139
EMIC REALITY: the unified field made up of thoughts, feelings and apparent sense impressions that organizes our inchoate experience into meaningful patterns; the paradigm or model that people create by talking to each other, or by communicating in any symbolism; the culture of a time and place; the semantic environment. Every emic reality has its own structure, which imposes structure upon raw experience.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 · Location 143
ETIC REALITY: the hypothetical actuality that has not been filtered through the emic reality of a human nervous system or linguistic grid.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 · Location 146 
INFORMATION: as used in mathematical information theory, this denotes the amount of unpredictability in a message; information is, roughly, what you do not expect to hear. In this sense, information may be "true" or "false," but is always a small surprise. Resistance to new information measures the degree of Fundamentalism in a culture, a sub-culture, or an individual.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 · Location 151
NEUROSEMANTICS: the study of how symbolism influences the human nervous system; how the local reality-tunnel programs our thoughts, feelings and apparent sense impressions.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 · Location 153
REALITY-LABYRINTH: existence regarded as a multiple-choice intelligence test; the sum total of reality-tunnels available to an open-minded or non-Fundamentalistic human at a given time and place.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 11 · Location 155
REALITY-TUNNEL: An emic reality established by a system of coding, or a structure of metaphors, and transmitted by language, art, mathematics or other symbolism.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 12 · Location 157
SYNERGY: those behaviors of whole systems which cannot be predicted by analysis of parts or sub-systems. A term popularized by Buckminster Fuller and roughly equivalent to Holism. Cf. Gestalt in psychology and transaction immediately following:

- Highlight(pink) - Page 12 · Location 160
TRANSACTION: used here in the sense of Transactional Psychology, which holds that perception is not passive re-action but active, creative trans-action, and that the "observer" and the "observed" must be considered a synergetic whole.

The late R. Buckminster Fuller—architect, engineer, poet, mathematician and gadfly—used to astonish audiences by remarking casually in the middle of a lecture that everything we see is inside our heads. If the consternation of the audience was voluble. Fuller would stop and explain, by drawing on the blackboard the diagram encountered in the elementary optics part of any first year physics course:

The upward arrow on the reader's left represents an "object" or, in more precise terms, a space-time event. The light rays from this existential knot or energy cluster travel to the lens of the eye which, like all lenses, reverses them and the retina then registers the reversed "image." We do not see things upside down because the retina is part of the synergetic eye-brain system and before we have a conscious perception of the energy-knot the brain has already interpreted and edited the signal into its system of classification, which includes turning it around to mesh with the general geometrical coordinate system the brain uses to "file" data.

Some people think they understand this the first time it is explained to them. Others, around the hundredth time it is explained, suddenly cry "Eureka!" and think they really understand it at last. In my experience teaching seminars on this area, nobody gets the full meaning of it until some experiments are performed which make it a vivid experience. Here is one such experiment which the reader is urgently implored to duplicate:

- Highlight(pink) - Page 14 · Location 196
Ask a friend to cooperate and then obtain a newspaper you have not already glanced over. Sit in a chair and have the friend, holding the newspaper so that you can read the front-page headlines, walk slowly away, across the room, until the headlines are blurry for you. Have the friend turn a page to ensure that you cannot read the headlines. Then have him, holding the newspaper in the same position, read a headline out loud. You will then "see" the headline clearly.

- Note: Similar experiements include hearing unintelligable speech, and when its played for a second time, it is supplemented with subtitles, allowing you to "hear" waht is being said

- Highlight(pink) - Page 14 · Location 202
Aristotle, without knowing the modern laws of optics, understood this general principle well enough to point out once that "I see" is an incorrect expression and really should be "I have seen." There is always time, however small, between the impact of a signal on our eye and the "perception" or "image" in our brains. In that interval the brain imposes form, meaning, color and a great deal else.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 14 · Location 207
What is true of the eye is true of the ear and of other senses.

On the face of it, once this has been pointed out, there seems no escape from an at least partial agnosticism—i.e. from recognition that all ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential. Aristotle escaped that conclusion, and until recently most philosophers and scientists have escaped it, by asserting or assuming or hoping that a method exists whereby the uncertainty of perceptions can be transcended and we can arrive at certitude about general principles.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 15 · Location 216
If perception is not absolute, no deduction from perception can be absolute. No matter how ingeniously one juggles with approximations, they do not magically turn into certainties; at best, they become the most accurate possible approximations.

Again: consider this well-known illustration, to be found in most general psychology texts:

If you see the line on the bottom as longer than the line on the top, your brain, working on habitual programs, has deceived you. The V and reverse-V decorations seduce the eye-brain system into seeing inaccurately. You have just had a mild hallucination.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 15 · Location 223
The processes (optical and neurological) by which "miracles" and "UFOs" are created and by which you "create" the chair across the room from you right now, are fundamentally similar to what just happened when you looked at those lines.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 15 · Location 225
If you think the chair is somehow more "objective" than a poem by Dylan Thomas or those pixillated lines, you might try the expensive experiment of hiring three painters and three photographers to come in and make you a "realistic portrait" of the chair. You will find that, in the photos as much as in the paintings, a personality has somehow given a meaning or a richness to the "object."

"The" Greeks as we say, or "the" ancient Greeks—the handful of ancient Greeks whose ideas we encounter in University, actually—were well aware of this fallibility of perception, and an illustration well-known in Athens in its Golden Age went like this: take three bowls of water. Make one of them quite hot, one medium-temperatured, and the third quite cold. Put your right hand in the hot bowl for a while and your left hand in the cold bowl. Then put both hands in the medium bowl. The same water will feel "cold" to your right hand and "hot" to your left hand. (Again, doing the experiment teaches more, neurosemantically, than merely reading about it.)

all the other methods of seeking certitude have a concealed "leap of faith" in them, which their devotees conveniently "forget" or overlook. So Kierkegaard asks: why not admit frankly that we are taking a "leap of faith"?

- Highlight(pink) - Page 17 · Location 257
My answer to that is that there is an alternative which appears more reasonable to some of us; namely to avoid the "leap of faith" and remain agnostic about all methods, although willing to learn from them in an open-minded way.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 17 · Location 268
Certitude is seized by some minds, not because there is any philosophical justification for it, but because such minds have an emotional need for certitude.

What I call Idols are projections of these inner compulsions of human psychology. When an Idol "speaks" (through its priests) it only says what the Faithful want to hear.

All thought consists of manipulations of symbols according to Game Rules. The combination of symbols and rules (for manipulating the symbols) makes up a system. When stripped down to their bare mathematico-logical bones, all systems appear to be either trivial or dubious. If trivial, they are certain, but we cannot learn much from them because they "refer" to very little. As soon as a system becomes less than totally trivial, and "refers" to more and more, a species of infinite regress enters it and it becomes increasingly uncertain: we have to prove, as it were, an endless series of steps between Step A and Step B before we can go on to Step C.

Back in the Renaissance, Francis Bacon, the father of empirical reasoning, announced that materialist science would allow man to “take nature by the forelock, hold her down, and submit her to our will.” He used a rape metaphor to describe the benefits of rational thinking. This is not a way of understanding nature, but forcing nature to conform to the model. As Korzybski and Wilson both liked to remind us, “the map is not the territory.” For Bacon, this means changing the territory to become more like the map.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 8 · Location 92
Indeed, fundamentalist materialist science is about quantifying everything. If you can’t measure something and assign a metric, it may as well not exist. Homeopathic medicine, human rapport, and the humanities themselves would fall into this category. Their benefits, even their very existence, cannot be acknowledged because there’s no instrument capable of quantifying them. That was bad enough.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 8 · Location 95
But in a digital age–and I’m convinced this is why Bob was interested in my own work–everything must be quantized. Things must not only be measurable, but they must be resolved to the nearest appropriate integer. Reality, auto-tuned to the nearest quantized gradient. Not only is the map the territory, but the map is now divided into discrete units. You can be at 49 latitude, or 50 latitude, but nowhere in-between. One or zero. Yes or No. Right or wrong.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 8 · Location 99
Reality is weirder than this. All you need to do is walk in nature, have sex, talk to a cat, or watch a David Lynch movie to understand there is more going on here than can be described by the standardized metrics of science or the sampling rates of digital recording devices. There’s information between the lines and off the map. Things happen that violate the laws, challenge our long-held assumptions, and suggest that reality is not what it seems.

- Highlight(pink) - Page 8 · Location 103
Bob’s message is more important right now than it was when he wrote it. Our digital fundamentalists see human beings as an engineering problem to be solved. Behaviors and thoughts that do not conform to our algorithmically generated profiles are to be eliminated, and humans shepherded into the reality tunnels that obey the laws of rationality alone.
