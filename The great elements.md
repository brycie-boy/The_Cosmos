## The great elements  # 

The four great elements, rather than representing mere atomic substances, instead represent four behavioral aspects of matter. the main four include:

- earth
   - solidity
- water
   - fluidity
- fire
   - energy
- air
   - distension

- space
- consciousness

The four main elements are inseparably linked in any unit of matter, from the smallest to the largest and most complex. The elements are not just properties of the external world, however, but also ones own body. Thus one must complacate them in relation to ones own body, as is done through the [[Attention to the great elementss]] exersize. The elements can be viewed as transient and conditioned, through [[The three standpoints]], and through [[The four nobel truths]].
