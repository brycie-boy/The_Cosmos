## The stages of mental refinement  #🧠 

In Buddhism, some suttas compare the successive stages in the purification of the mind through the development of [[Serenity]] to the refinement of gold. The meditator begins by removing the impurities of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct (see [[The ten pathways of wholesome and unwholsome kamma]]). This is done through moral disipline and vigilant introspection. They then move on to the middle-level impurities of unwholesome thoughts: thoughts of sensuality, ill will, and harmfulness. Next come the subtle impurities of miandering thought. Finally comes removing thoughts about the [[Dhamma]], the most subtle of the obsticals. When all distracting thoughts are removed, the meditator attains "mental unification", which can be directed towards [[Supernormal Powers]], culminating in [[Arahant]]ship through the knowledge of the distruction of [[The taints]].
