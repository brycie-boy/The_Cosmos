## Opposing Ideas which threaten ones status or comfort zone are generally processed as a threat and are disregarded  # 

the [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] also contains the pack's status programs or pecking order. Working in tandem with the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] anxieties, it is always able to pervert the fuctioning of the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]]. What ever threatens loss to status, or what over invades one's "space" (including one’s ideological “head space”), is a threat to the average domesticated primate.  Thus, if a poor man has one status prop in his life—“I’m a white man, not a goddam nigger” or “I’m normal, not a goddam faggot” or whatever—any attempt to preach tolerance, common humanity, relativism, etc. is not processed through the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]] circuit but through the older circuits, and is rejected as an attack on status ([[The ego]], social role).

Of course, preaching is bad second circuit politics, since it puts you one up on the person being preached at. You are not one up unless imprinted as an alpha male in the same gene-pool or conditioned as such by being the "boss" or some other authority figure. [[The counter-culture movement]] of the 1960’s, like may other idealistic movements, failed because it did so much preaching from a morally one-up position when nobody had been imprinted or conditioned to accept it as one-up.
