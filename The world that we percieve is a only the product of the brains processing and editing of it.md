## The world that we percieve is a only the product of the brains processing and editing of it  #

The late  [[R. Buckminster Fuller]] used to astonish audiences by casually remarking in the middle of a lecture that everything we see is all in our heads. If the consternation of the audience was voluble, Fuller would stop and explain that when the light rays from an object travel to the lens of the eye, like all lenses, it reverses it. The retina then registers the reversed "image". We do not see things upsidedown because the retina is part of a synergetic eye-brain system and before [[Consciousness]] of the object arises, the function of [[Perception]] has already interperted and classified the signal according to the brains system of classification, which includes turning the image around and meshing it with the geometrical coordinate system the brain uses to file data.
