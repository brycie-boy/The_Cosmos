## Heading  # 

In one of his earliest discources popularly known as "The Fire Sermon", [[The Buddha]] declared that "all is burning". The "all" is the six sense bases, their objects, the types of [[consciousness]] arisen from them, and the related contacts and feelings. The way to [[Nibbana]] is to see that this "all" is burning with [[The three unwholesome roots]] and dissatisfaction of [[The three characteristics]]. 

To dispell ignorance and generate true knowledge, we must contemplate the senses and the feelings that arises them from through [[The three characteristics]]. This, according to [[The Nikayas]], is the direct way to the realization of [[Nibbana]]. An alternative route is to see the senses as empty of a self or anything belonging to a self.
