## The mind base  # 

What the first five of the [[Six sense bases]] signify is obvious enough, but the sixth pair, mind and phenomena present some difficulty. If the two terms are to be treated parellel to the other internal and external bases, we would understand the mind base to be the support for mind-[[consciousness]], and phenomena to be the objective sphere of mind-[[consciousness]]. On this interpertation, "mind" might be seen as the passive flow of [[consciousness]] from which active conceptual [[consciousness]] emerges, and phenomena simply as mental objects such as those apprehended by introspection, imagination, and reflection. The abhidhamma and Pali commentaries, however, interpret the two terms differently. They hold that the mind base comprises all six types of [[consciousness]], and that all actual entities not comprised in the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomena base then includes the other three mental aggregates—[[Sensation]], [[Perception]], and [[Volitional formations]]—as well as types of subtle material form not experienced through the physical senses
