## We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments #üß† 

In order to arrive at the realization of [[Nibbana]], we have to learn to see beneath the surface of the glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of [[perception]], thought, and views, that habbitually cloke our vision.

Certitude is seized by some minds not because there is a philosophical justification for it, but because such minds have an emotional need for it. Ordinarily, we represent the world to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases which are shaped by our craving and attachments (which they in turn reinforce). We only see and cling to the things that we want to see; and we tune out and push away the things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, and throw into question the comforting assumtions about ourselves and our reality. To undo this whole process requires a commitment to truth that is initially unsettling but in the end proves liberating and exhilerating. To demonstate this phenomena to oneself, [[Robert Anton Wilson]] provides [[The Aristotelian "true" "false" quiz]].
