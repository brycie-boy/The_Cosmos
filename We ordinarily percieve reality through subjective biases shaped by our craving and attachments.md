## We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments #

In order to arrive at the realization of [[Nibbana]], we have to learn to see beneath the surface of the glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception, thought, and views, that habbitually cloke our vision.

Ordinarily, we represent things to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases which shaped by the craving and attachments of the the older reptilian  [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] and the mammalian [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] (which they in turn reinforce), rather than the human/rational [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]]. Thus, this circuit is easily lead into fasle logics (bigotries, intolerant ideologies, fanaticisms, delusion, etc.) when the [[Oral Bio-Survival Circuit]] signals threat to life or when the [[Anal Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] flashes threat to status. Consequentially, we end up seeing only the things that we want to see; and we blot out the things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, and throw into question the comforting assumtions about ourselves and our lives. Cynics, satirists, and mystics often emphasized that "reason is a whore", ie, the semantic sircuit is natoriosly vulnerable to the manipulation of the older, more primitive circuits. 

However much the rationalist may resent this, it is always true in the short run that whoever can scare people enough (produce bio-survival anxiety) can sell any map disguised as relief. By frightening people with "Hell" and then offering them "Salvation", the most ignorant or crooked individuals can sell a whole system of thought that cannot bear two minutes of rational analysis. As [[Jesus Christ]] famously warned: "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

To undo this whole process requires a commitment to truth that is initially unsettling but in the end proves liberating and exhilerating. This can be done by using the [[The three standpoints]].
