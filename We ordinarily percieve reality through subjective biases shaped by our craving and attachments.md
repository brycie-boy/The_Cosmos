## We ordinarily percieve reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments #

In order to arrive at the realization of [[Nibbana]], we have to learn to see beneath the surface of the glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception, thought, and views, that habbitually cloke our vision.

Ordinarily, we represent things to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases which shaped by the craving and attachments (which they in turn reinforce). Consequentially, we end up seeing only the things that we want to see; and we blot out the things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, and throw into question the comforting assumtions about ourselves and our lives. 

To undo this whole process requires a commitment to truth that is initially unsettling but in the end proves liberating and exhilerating. This can be done by using the [[The three standpoints]].
